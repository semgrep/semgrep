// OPAM caching
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

// The step below uses the actions/cache@v3 GHA extension to cache
// the ~/.opam directory which speedups a lot the "Install opam dependencies"
// steps in our workflows, especially the one where we can't use ocaml-layer.
// See also actions.libsonnet for other GHA caching helpers.
// Note that actions/setup-ocaml@v2 is using a similar technique.
//
// For example, on GHA-hosted macos runners, without caching the osx workflow
// would run very for 35min instead of 10min with caching.
// The M1 build runs on fast self-hosted runners where caching does not seem
// to be necessary.
// In Linux, we use a special container (returntocorp/ocaml:alpine-xxx) to
// bring in the required dependencies, which makes 'opam switch create'
// and 'opam install deps' unnecessary and almost a noop.
// Still, we are gradually getting rid of ocaml-layer and replace it with
// this more general caching mechanism (or switch to setup-ocaml@v2).
//
// alt:
//  - use a self-hosted runner where we can save the content of ~/.opam between
//    runs and do whatever we want. The problem is that the build is then
//    not "hermetic", and we ran in many issues such as the disk of the
//    self-hosted runner being full, or some stuff being left from other CI
//    runs (such as a semgrep install) entering in conflicts with some of our
//    build steps. This also requires some devops work to create and maintain
//    those pools of self-hosted runners.
//  - use a GHA-hosted runner which is nice because we don't have to do
//    anything, and the build are guaranteed to be hermetic. The only problem
//    originally was that it was slower, and for unknown reasons ocamlc was
//    not working well on those macos-12 GHA runners, but caching the ~/.opam
//    with actions/cache@v3 seems to solve the speed issue (and maybe ocamlc
//    works now well under macos-12).
//  - use a technique similar to what we do for Linux with our special
//    ocaml-layer container, but can this be done for macos?
//  - use setup-ocaml@v2 which internally uses a GHA cache too, but this
//    cache just the downloaded package; it still install/compiles the packages
//    each time.
//
// See also https://www.notion.so/semgrep/Caching-the-Opam-Environment-5d7e594203884d289acdac53713fb39f
// for more information.

// Note that this action does cache read and cache write.
// See https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows
// for more information on GHA caching.
//
// See also https://github.com/organizations/semgrep/settings/actions/caches
// (requires admin access to github org) to see the GHA cache settings
// and https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep/actions/caches?query=sort%3Asize-desc
// to see the actual cache files created and used.
//
// Note that from the doc:
// "Workflow runs cannot restore caches created for child branches or sibling
//  branches. For example, a cache created for the child feature-b branch would
//  not be accessible to a workflow run triggered on the parent main branch.
//  Similarly, a cache created for the feature-a branch with the base main
//  would not be accessible to its sibling feature-c branch with the base main."
// This explains why you can see multiple cache entries with the exact same
// cache key name; it's because they are from different branches.

// Note that this caching works and speedup things because of the way OPAM works
// and osx-setup-for-release.sh is written. Indeed, this script checks
// if the opam switch is already created, and if a package is already
// installed (in ~/.opam), then opam install on this package will do nothing.

// Sometimes the cache key is not precise enough and some external changes
// do not trigger cache invalidation but should. For example, we use
// hashFiles('semgrep.opam') in many workflows for the cache key, but
// semgrep.opam is not a lock file and some updates in the opam repo might
// trigger the recompilation/installation of packages which would slow
// down the workflow, even in the presence of the GHA cache, because this
// cache is not up to date with the opam repo. Same for changes such as
// an upgrade from opam 2.1 to 2.2 which is not captured in the cache key
// but which should invalidate the cache.
// This bump_cache is one way to cope with the limitations of our cache keys.
// Moreover, GHA itself does not have a big "delete all cache" button like
// in depot.dev so this bump_cache can act as one too.
