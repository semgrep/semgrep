  # Running pre-commit in CI. See semgrep/.pre-commit-config.yaml for

  # and testing how semgrep interact with pre-commit.

      # note that in a CI context pre-commit runs the hooks with the '--all' flag, so
      # semgrep for example is passed all the files in the repository, not just
      # the one modifed in the PR (as it is the case when it's ran from git hooks locally).
      # This is why sometimes pre-commit passes locally but fails in CI, for the same PR.
      - uses: pre-commit/action@v3.0.0

  # This is mostly a copy-paste of the pre-commit job above. The only difference
  # is the 'extra_args:' directive, which runs semgrep/.pre-commit-config.yaml#L150,
  # which runs Semgrep Bandit and Semgrep Python, which we don't run on normal pre-commit
  # since they would slow down pre-commit on local development.
  # An alternative would be to add the last step of this job in the pre-commit job above,
  # but jobs can run in parallel, hence the copy-paste to speed things up.
  # The intention is a test that runs semgrep-pre-commit.
  # (TODO: actually it looks like we also run Semgrep Bandit/Python in normal pre-commit)
  # TODO? should we split this out to a different config?
