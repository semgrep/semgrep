  # This is mostly a copy-paste of the pre-commit job above. The only difference
  # is the extra_args: directive, which runs semgrep/.pre-commit-config.yaml#L150,
  # which runs Semgrep Bandit and Semgrep Python, which we don't run on normal pre-commit
  # since they would slow down pre-commit on local development.
  # (TODO: actually it looks like we also run Semgrep Bandit/Python in normal pre-commit)
  # The intention is a test that runs semgrep-pre-commit.
  # TODO? should we split this out to a different config?
  # We could add the last step of this job in the pre-commit job above, but jobs can run
  # in parallel, hence the copy-paste.
