# Context:
#
# Initially, the commit message for a merged github PR uses the
# "squash and merge" setting, but oftentimes people write short and
# uninformational commit messages, such as "more work", etc.
#
# We switched to another github setting that uses the PR title and
# description for the commit message of a merged PR.
#
# At the same time, we would like to have a PR checklist to help
# developers write better PRs.
#
# This checklist could be automatically added to all PR descriptions
# with .github/pull_request_template.md, but this adds noise to
# every commit message and requires manual work to remove before
# merging.
#
# We decided to create a workflow to add the checklist as a comment
# on the PR instead, so developers will have a checklist, and
# the PR descriptions won't be cluttered.
