PR checklist:

- [ ] Documentation is up-to-date
- [ ] `changelog.d/<issue>.<type>` is a file with the _what_, _why_, and _how_ of the change.
  - \<issue> is `pa-312` (Linear ticket), `gh-1234` (GitHub issue), or `new-gizmo` (unique semantic name)
  - \<type> is `added`, `changed`, `fixed`, or `infra`.
- [ ] Change has no security implications (otherwise, ping security team)
