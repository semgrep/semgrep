# Many targets in this Makefile assume some commands have been run before to
# setup the correct build environment supporting the different languages
# used for Semgrep development:
#  - for OCaml: 'ocamlc' and 'ocamlopt' (currently 4.14.0), 'dune', 'opam'
#  - for C: 'gcc', 'ld', 'pkgconfig', but also some C libs like PCRE, gmp
#  - for Python: 'python3', 'pip', 'pipenv'
#
# You will also need obviously 'make', but also 'git', and many other
# common dev tools (e.g., 'docker', 'bash').
#
# Once this basic building/development environment has been setup
# (see the different 'install-deps-XXX-yyy' targets later to assist you),
# you can then use:
#
#     $ make install-deps
#
# to install the dependencies proper to semgrep (e.g., the necessary OPAM
# packages used by semgrep-core).
#
# Then to compile semgrep simply type:
#
#     $ make all
#
# See INSTALL.md for more information
# See also https://semgrep.dev/docs/contributing/contributing-code/

# Most of the targets in this Makefile should work equally under
# Linux (Alpine, Ubuntu, Arch), macOS (x86 and arm64), Windows (WSL, Cygwin),
# and from a Dockerfile.
# The main exceptions are the install-deps-XXX-yyy targets below.

# If you really have to use platform-specific commands or flags, try to use
# macros like the one below to have a portable Makefile.
#
#     # To select commands with different usage under GNU/Linux and *BSD/Darwin
#     ifeq ($(shell uname -s),Linux)
#       LINUX = true
#     else
#       LINUX = false
#     endif
#     ifeq ($(LINUX),true)
#       SED = sed -i -e
#     else
#       SED = sed -i ''
#     endif

# This is to deal with paths that change depending on whether we're in the
# semgrep-proprietary monorepo or detached as a standalone semgrep project.
# The script 'scripts/make-symlinks' also deals with such issues.

# We need to install all the dependencies in a single 'opam install'

# This target is portable; it only assumes you have 'gcc', 'opam' and

# **************************************************
# Platform-dependent dependencies installation
# **************************************************

# The constants and targets below are used in our Dockerfile and a few
# GHA workflows. There are pros and cons of having those commands here
# instead of in the Dockerfile and GHA workflows:
# cons:
#  - this requires the Makefile and so to checkout (COPY in Docker
#    or actions/checkout@v3 in GHA) semgrep first,
#    which prevent some caching Docker/GHA could do. This is alleviated
#    a bit by the fact that anyway we use a special returntocorp/ocaml
#    container with many things pre-installed.
# pro:
#  - it avoids repeating yourself everywhere

# -------------------------------------------------
# Packages
# -------------------------------------------------
# TODO: opam can in theory handle automatically external dependencies
# via `opam depext ...`, so we should not need for each Linux distro to know
# what is the corresponding package name. This info is actually
# stored in many conf-xxx OPAM packages and since opam 2.2.0 should
# support also Windows!
# So we should generalize our use of WINDOWS_OPAM_DEPEXT_DEPS to all platforms.

# Here is why we need those external packages to compile semgrep-core:
# - pkgconf (name of pkg-config clone in arch): required by opam/dune
#   so it can find the location of the other libs
# - pcre: for ocaml-pcre now used in semgrep-core (used by spacegrep)
# - pcre2: new version of pcre needed by Cooper
# - gmp: for osemgrep and its use of cohttp (LGPL since gmp 6)
# - libev: ?? for Austin
# - curl: for opentelemetry, which we use for tracing for Emma
# - openssl: ??
# - zlib: ??
# - openssl-libs-static: dependency of curl-static
