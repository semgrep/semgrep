# It allows to call semgrep from pre-commit

# This hook does not use 'docker_image' like the one below, and so is significantly
# faster (especially on macOS).

  # If you use 'language: python', then pre-commit expects a toplevel 'setup.py'.
  # This ./setup.py was defined just for pre-commit. Essentially, setup.py
  # runs 'pip install semgrep==0.xxx.yyy'. It means that this hook does not even
  # rely on the code in this repository; it just relies on pip and the availability
  # of semgrep in pypy.
