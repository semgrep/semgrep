Those languages are currently skipped because we have some time limits in our CI
and they are not as important as the other languages,
so it's simpler to not slowdown the parsing-stats jobs with those languages.

Some languages are now also here because they are not in semgrep-oss anymore
but in semgrep-pro only (e.g., Elixir).
