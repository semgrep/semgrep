generic mode: allow text input without human-readable indentation up to 500
bytes. This value is subject to change. This relaxing is intended to
facilitate testing where someone might copy-paste a long line without a
trailing newline. Semgrep users should not expect files that are not
human-readable to be processed in semgrep's generic mode, or in any mode for
the matter.
