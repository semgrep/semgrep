taint-mode: Java: Support for basic field sensitivity via getters and setters.
Given `obj.setX(tainted)`, Semgrep will identify that a subsequent `obj.getX()`
carries the same taint as `tainted`. It will also differentiate between
`obj.getX()` and `obj.getY()`. Note that Semgrep does not examine the definitions
for the getter or setter methods, and it does not know whether e.g. some other
method `obj.clearX()` clears the taint that `obj.setX(tainted)` adds.
