Added performance metrics using OpenTelemetry for better visualization.
Users wishing to understand the performance of their Semgrep scans or
to help optimize Semgrep can configure the backend collector created in
`libs/tracing/unix/Tracing.ml`.

This is experimental and both the implementation and flags are likely to
change.
