Add experimental support for _taint labels_, that is the ability to attach labels to
different kinds of taint. Both sources and sinks can retrict what labels are present
in the data that passes through them in order to apply. This allows to write more
complex taint rules that previously required ugly workarounds. Taint labels also
allows us to write certain classes of typestate analyses (e.g., check that a file
descriptor is not used after being closed).
