Added additional output flags which allow you to write output to multiple files in multiple formats.

For example, the comand `semgrep ci --text --json-output=result.json --sarif-output=result.sarif.json`
Displays text output on stdout, writes the output that would be generated by passing the `--json` flag
to `result.json`, and writes the output that would be generated by passing the `--sarif` to `result.sarif.json`.
