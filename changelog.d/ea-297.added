metrics: added more granular information about pro engine configurations to
help differentiate scans using different engine capabilities. For instance,
maintainers are now able to distinguish intraprocedural scans without secrets
validation from intraprocedural scans with secrets validation. This allows us
to have a better understanding of usage and more accurately identify
product-specific issues (e.g., to see if something only affects secrets scans).
