Relaxed restrictions on symbolic propagation so that symbolic values survive
branching statements. Now (with symbolic-propagation enabled) `foo(bar())` will
match match the following code:

```python
def test():
  x = bar()
  if cond:
    exit()
  foo(x)
```

Previously any symbolically propagated value was lost after any kind of branching
statement.
