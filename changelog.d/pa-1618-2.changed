Reduce memory consumption of semgrep by passing the targets in a more condensed
structure. Previously, we told semgrep which rules to run on which target by
listing out all the rule_ids each target should run. Now, we have a separate
rule_id list and for each target we only ilst the rule_id indices. On large
repos, particularly when run with multiple processes, this has a significant
impact.
