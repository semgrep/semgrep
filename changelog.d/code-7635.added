Type inference in the Pro engine has been improved for class fields in
TypeScript that are assigned a new instance but lack an explicit type
definition. When no explicit type is provided for a class field, its type is
inferred from the type of the expression assigned to it. For example, in the
class definition `class Foo { private readonly bar = new Bar(); }`, the type of
`bar` is inferred to be `Bar`.
