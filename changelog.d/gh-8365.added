Added support for naming propagation when the left-hand side (lhs) of a variable definition is an identifier pattern

In certain languages like Rust, the variable definition is parsed as a pattern assignment, for example:

```
let x: SomeType = SomeFunction();
```

This commit ensures that the annotated type is propagated to the identifier pattern on the left-hand side (lhs) of the assignment, thus ensuring proper naming behavior.
