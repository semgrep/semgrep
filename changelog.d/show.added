There is a new 'semgrep show' command to display information about
semgrep, for example 'semgrep show supported-languages'. The goal is to
cleanup 'semgrep scan' which is currently abused to not scan but
also display semgrep information (e.g., 'semgrep scan --show-supported-languages).
See 'semgrep show --help' for more information.
