taint-mode: Semgrep was missing some sources occurring inside type expressions,
for example:

```cpp
char *p = new char[source(x)];
sink(x);
```

Now, if `x` is tainted by side-effect, Semgrep will check `x` inside the type
expression `char[...]` and record it as tainting, and generate a finding for
`sink(x)`.
