taint-mode: Added a Boolean `exact` option to sources and sanitizers to make
matching stricter (default is `false`).

If you specify a source such as `foo(...)`, and Semgrep encounters `foo(x)`,
by default `foo(x)`, `foo`, and `x`, will all be considered tainted. If you add
`exact: true` to the source specification, then only `foo(x)` will be regarded
as tainted, that is the "exact" match for the specification. The same applies
to "exact" sanitizers.
