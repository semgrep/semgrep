taint-mode: Added a Boolean `exact` option to sources and sanitizers to make
matching stricter (default is `false`).

If you specify a source such as `foo(...)`, and Semgrep encounters `foo(x)`,
by default both `foo(x)` and `x` will be considered tainted. If you add
`exact: true` to the source specification, then only `foo(x)` will be regarded
as tainted. The same applies to sanitizers.
