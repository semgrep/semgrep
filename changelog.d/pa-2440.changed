Pro: Add **experimental** flags `--pro` and `--interproc`. Using `--pro` you can
enable Apex support, and with `--fast-deep` you can enable intra-file inter-procedural
taint analysis. Also, `--deep` has been renamed to `--interfile`. Note that to use
any of the Pro features you must first run `semgrep install-semgrep-pro` while being
logged in.
