When `metavariable-type` cannot be evaluated then it defauls to "false", that is,
it filters out the range. Therefore e.g. this rule:

```yaml
    patterns:
      - pattern: private int $X;
      - metavariable-type:
          metavariable: $Y
          type: int
```

now will produce no matches because `$Y` is not bound to anything.
