Java: Semgrep will now recognize `String.format(...)` expressions as constant
strings when all their arguments are constant, but it will still not know
what exact string it is. For example, code `String.format("Abc %s", "123")`
will match pattern `"..."` but it will _not_ match pattern `"Abc 123"`.
