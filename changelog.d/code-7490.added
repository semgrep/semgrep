Pro: taint-mode: Allow (experimental) control taint to propagate through `return`s.

Now this taint rule:

    pattern-sources:
    - control: true
      pattern: taint()
    pattern-sinks:
    - pattern: sink()

It is able to find this:

    def foo():
      taint()

    def test():
      foo()
      sink() # now it is found!
