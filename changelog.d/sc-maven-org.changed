Packages from the maven ecosystem are now parsed to include their org slug. This means a log4j rule must now use `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core` instead of just `log4j-core`. This change is backwards incompatible, in that any Java Supply Chain rules not taking into account will stop producing any findings, since the packages parsed from lockfiles will include the org, but the old rules will not.
