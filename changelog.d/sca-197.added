Updated the supply chain finding API:
- The API is now typed and defined entirely in semgrep_output_v0.atd
- Supply chain findings now have only one dependency match, not a list, and only one resolved url
- Supply chain findings now have a field called reachable and reachability_rule,
  which indicate if the finding is reachable, and whether or not it was generated
  by a reachability rule (rule that had a semgrep pattern)
- Supply chain findings now include a schema version
- The complete finding information sent to semgrep app now includes a mapping from lockfile
  paths to the number of dependencies that were present in that lockfile
