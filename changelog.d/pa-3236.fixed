In C++, the string literal now has a type of `char *`. It won't match with the
`string` type. For instance,

```yaml
- metavariable-type:
    metavariable: $EXPR
    type: string
```

will only match

```cpp
string f;
// MATCH
int x = f.length();
```

but not

```cpp
const char *s;
// OK
s = "foo";
```
