Fixed metavariable comparison in step mode.

Used to be that the rule:
```yaml
    steps:
        - languages: [python]
          patterns:
            - pattern: x = f($VAR);
        - languages: [generic]
          patterns:
            - pattern-either:
               - patterns:
                - pattern: HI $VAR
```
Wouldn't match, as one is an identifier, and the other an expression that has a
string literal. The fix was chainging the equality used.
