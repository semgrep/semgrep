Pro: const-prop: Previously inter-procedural const-prop could only infer whether
a function returned an arbitrary string constant. Now it is now able to infer
whether a function returns a concrete constant value, e.g.:

```python
def bar():
  return "bar"

def test():
  x = bar()
  foo(x) # now also matches pattern `foo("bar")`, previously only `foo("...")`
```
