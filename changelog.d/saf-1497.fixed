Fixed regex-fix numbered capture groups, where it used to be the case that
a `replacement:` regex with numbered capture groups like `\1\2\3` would effectivly
be the same as `\1\1\1`.

After the fix:
```python
# src.py
12345
```
```yaml
pattern: $X
fix-regex:
      regex: (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)
      replacement: \5\4\3\2\1
```
actually results in the fix
```python
54321
```
