Pro: taint-mode: Fixed issue causing findings to be missed (false negatives)
when a global or class field was tainted, and then used in a sink after two
or more function calls.

For example:

    class Test {
        string bad;

        void test() {
            bad = "taint";
            foo();
        }

        void foo() {
            bar();
        }

        void bar() {
            sink(bad); // finding no longer missed
        }
    }
