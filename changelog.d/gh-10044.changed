Passing --debug to Semgrep will not print much, unless a set of tags is specified
via `LOG_TAGS`. You can get all debug logs with `LOG_TAGS=everything`. We do not
want --debug's output to be enourmous, as it tends not to be useful and yet cause
some problems. Note that --debug is mainly intended for Semgrep developers, please
ask for help if needed.
