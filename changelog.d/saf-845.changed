[IMPORTANT] Logged in users running `semgrep ci` will now run the pro engine by default! All `semgrep ci` scans will run with our proprietary languages (Apex and Elixir), as well as cross-function taint within a single file, and other single file pro optimizations we have developed. This is equivalent to `semgrep ci --pro-intrafile`. Users will likely see improved results if they are running `semgrep ci` and did not already have additional configuration to enable pro analysis.

The current default engine does not include cross-file analysis. To scan with cross-file analysis, turn on the app toggle or pass in the flag `--pro`. We recommend this unless you have very large repos (talk to our support to get help enabling cross-file analysis on monorepos!)

To revert back to our OSS analysis, pass the flag `--oss-only` (or use `--pro-languages` to continue to receive our proprietary languages).

Reminder: because we release first to our canary image, this change will only immediately affect you if you are using `semgrep/semgrep:canary`. If you are using `semgrep/semgrep:latest`, it will affect you when we bump canary to latest.
