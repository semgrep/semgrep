In generic mode (default, spacegrep engine), matching a pattern that
ends with an ellipsis now favors the longest match rather than the shortest
match when multiple matches are possible. For example, for a given target
program `a a b`, the pattern `a ... b` will match `a b` as before but
the pattern `a ...` will now match the longer `a a b` rather than `a b`.
