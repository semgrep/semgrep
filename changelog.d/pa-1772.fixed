Changed symbolic propagation such that "redundant" matches are no longer reported as findings. For instance:

```py
def foo():
  x = g(5)
  f(x)
```

If we are looking for the pattern `g(5)`, we should not match on line 3, since we will match on line 2 anyways,
and this is just repeating information that we already know.

This patch changes it so that we do not match on line 3 anymore.
