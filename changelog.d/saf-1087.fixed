In the app, you can configure Secrets ignores separately from Code/SSC ignores. However, the
files that were ignored by Code/SSC and not Secrets were still being scanned during the
preprocessing stage for interfile analysis. This caused significantly longer scan times than
expected for some users, since those ignored files can ignore library code. This PR fixes that
behavior and makes Code/SSC ignores apply as expected.
