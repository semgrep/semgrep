A new experimental 'extract' mode. This mode runs a Semgrep rule on a codebase
and "extracts" code from matches, treating it as a different language. This
allows users to supplement an existing set of rules, e.g., for JavaScript, by
writing additional rules to find JavaScript in non-JavaScript files, e.g.,
JavaScript contained in HTML or template files. While this is somewhat possible
with metavariable-pattern, this reduces the work from an M \* N problem to an M
+ N one.
