Pro: Improved module resolution for Python. Imports like `from a.b import c` where
`c` is a module will now be resolved by Semgrep. And, if a module cannot be found
in the search path, Semgrep will try to heuristically resolve the module by matching
the module specifier against the files that are being scanned.
