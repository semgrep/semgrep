Optional type matching is supported in the Pro engine for Python. For example,
in Python, `Optional[str]`, `str | None`, and `Union[str, None]` represent the
same type but in different type expressions. The optional type match support
enables matching between these expressions, allowing any optional type
expression to match any other optional type expression when used with
metavariable-type filtering. It's important to note that syntactic pattern
matching still distinguishes between these types.
