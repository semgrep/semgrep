[IMPORTANT] Inter-file differential scanning is now enabled for all users.

Inter-file differential scanning is now enabled for all users. While it may
take longer than intra-file differential scanning, which is the current default
for pro users, it offers deeper analysis of dataflow paths compared to
intra-file differential scanning. Additionally, it is significantly faster
than non-differential inter-file scanning, with scan times reduced to
approximately 1/10 of the non-differential inter-file scan. Users who
enable the pro engine and engage in differential PR scans on GitHub or
GitLab may experience the impact of this update. If needed, users can
revert to the previous intra-file differential scan behavior by configuring
the `--diff-depth -1` command-line option.
