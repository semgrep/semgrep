Expanded support for pip requirement lockfiles is now available by default. Semgrep will now
find any *requirement*.txt file and lockfiles in a requirements folder (**/requirements/*.txt).
The existing experimental flag `--enable-experimental-requirements` is now deprecated and
will be removed in a future release.
