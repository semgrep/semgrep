When semgrep ci finishes scanning and uploads findings, it tells the
app to mark the scan as completed.

For large findings, this may take a while and marking the scan as
completed may timeout. When a scan is not marked as completed, the app
may show that the repo is still processing, and confuses the user.

This change increases the timeout (previously 20 minutes) to 30
minutes.
