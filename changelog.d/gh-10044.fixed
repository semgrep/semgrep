The environment variable `LOG_LEVEL` (as well as `PYTEST_LOG_LEVEL`) is
no longer consulted by Semgrep to determine the log level. Only
`SEMGREP_LOG_LEVEL` is consulted. `PYTEST_SEMGREP_LOG_LEVEL` is also
consulted in the current implementation but should not be used outside of
Semgrep's Pytest tests. This is to avoid accidentally affecting Semgrep
when inheriting the `LOG_LEVEL` destined to another application.
