The main regex engine is now PCRE2 (was PCRE). While the syntax is mostly
compatible, there are some minor instances where updates to rules may be
needed, since PCRE2 is slightly more strict in some cases. For example, while
we previously accepted `[\w-.]`, such a pattern would now need to be written
`[\w_.]` or `[\w\-.]` since PCRE2 rejects the first as having an invalid range.
