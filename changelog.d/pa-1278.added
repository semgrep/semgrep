taint-mode: Experimental support for basic field-sensitive taint tracking.
Semgrep can now track `x.a` and `x.b` separately, so that e.g. `x.a` can be
tainted at the same time as `x.b` is clean, hence `sink(x.a)` would produce
a finding but `sink(x.b)` would not. It is also possible for `x` to be tainted
while `x.a` is clean. We expect this to have an net positive effect by reducing
false positives.
