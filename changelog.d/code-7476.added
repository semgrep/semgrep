Pro: taint-mode: Semgrep has now basic support to track taint through callbacks,
when they lead to a sink, e.g.:

    function unsafe_callback(x) {
      sink(x); // finding here now !
    }

    function withCallback(val, callback) {
      callback(val);
    }

    withCallback(taint, unsafe_callback);
