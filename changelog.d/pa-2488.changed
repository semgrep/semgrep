Pro: `--pro` will now enable _all_ Pro features, including Apex, inter-procedural taint
analysis, and also inter-file analysis for supported languages. For Apex support only
(and more languages in the future) now use `--pro-languages`. For intra-file analysis
only now use `--pro-intrafile`. Flags `--interproc` and `--interfile` are now
deprecated.
