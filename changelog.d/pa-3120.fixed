Support labeled let bindings within Swift case statements

Correctly parsing labeled let bindings within Swift case statements.
For instance, the code snippet:
```
switch self {
  case .bar(_, _, x: let y):
    return y
}
```

now successfully matches the pattern:
```
switch self {case .$X(..., $Y: $Z): ...}
```
