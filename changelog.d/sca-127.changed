Updated SCA finding generation so that the following hold:
- One SCA finding per vulnerable dependency. If one rule matches multiple dependencies in one lockfile,
  that will produce multiple findings. This still needs to be codified in the typed interface
- No findings in files that were not targeted. If foo.py depends on Pipfile.lock,
  and foo.py is targeted but Pipfile.lock is not, then we can produce reachable findings
  in foo.py but not non-reachable findings in Pipfile.lock. If Pipfile.lock is included in
  our targets then we can produce non-reachable findings inside of it
- No massive single scan for lockfiles.
