Extract mode: users can now choose to include or exclude rules to run on, similar to `paths:`. For example,
to only run on the rules `example-1` and `example-2`, you would write

```
rules:
   - id: test-rule
     mode: extract
     rules:
        include:
        - example-1
        - example-2
```

To run on everything except `example-1` and `example-2`, you would write

```
rules:
   - id: test-rule
     mode: extract
     rules:
        exclude:
        - example-1
        - example-2
```
