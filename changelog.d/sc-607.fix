Output lines in GitHub Actions logs could appear scrambled,
due to GitHub Actions mixing together the stdout and stderr streams
in non-deterministic order.
Semgrep will now log everything only to one stream in GitHub Actions
when using text output mode,
which ensures lines no longer appear scrambled.
