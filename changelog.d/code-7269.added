Matching of fully qualified type names in the metavariable-type operator has
been improved. For example:

```
from a.b import C

x = C()
```

The type of `x` will match both `a.b.C` and `C`.

```
  - pattern: $X = $Y()
  - metavariable-type:
      metavariable: $X
      types:
        - a.b.C  # or C
```
