Matching: Matches with the same range but bindings in different locations
will now no longer deduplicate.

For instance, the pattern `$FUNC(..., $A, ...)` would produce only
one match on the target file:
```
foo(true, true)
```
because you would have two matches to the range of the call, and both
bindings of `$A` would be to `true`.

Now, the deduplication logic sees that the bindings of `$A` are in
different places, and thus should not be considered the same, and
produce two matches.
