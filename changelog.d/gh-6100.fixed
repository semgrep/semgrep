Hold references to `NamedTemporaryFile` objects while their corresponding
temporary files are still in use by the core runner. Failure to explicitly hold
references to these objects on some Python implementations, such as PyPy,
results in them sometimes being garbage-collected during processing. This,
in turn, triggers removal of the temp files while they are still in use by
the core runner or the worker subprocesses, resulting in various crashes and
processing failures.
