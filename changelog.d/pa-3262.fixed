In expression-based languages, definitions are also expressions.

This change allows dataflow to properly handle definition expressions.

For example, the pattern `0 == 0` will match `x == 0` in

```elixir
def f(c) do
  x = (y = 0)
  x == 0
end
```

because now dataflow is able to handle the expression `y = 0`.
