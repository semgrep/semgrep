`-filter_irrelevant_rules` was incorrectly skipping files when the PCRE engine threw
an error, while trying to match a regex that determines whether a rule is relevant
for a file. This has been fixed so that, in case of a PCRE error, we assume that the
rule could be relevant and we do run it on the file.
