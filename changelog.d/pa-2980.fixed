taint-mode: Fixed recently added `by-side-effect: only` option for taint sources,
so that it does not incorrectly taint expressions that are not l-values, e.g.
given this taint source:

```yaml
pattern-sources:
  - by-side-effect: only
    patterns:
      - pattern: delete $VAR;
      - focus-metavariable: $VAR
```

The `get(*from)` expression should not become tainted since it's not an l-value:

```cpp
delete get(*from);
```
