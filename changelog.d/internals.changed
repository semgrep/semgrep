The semgrep_main.py module has been renamed to run_scan.py and its
invoke_semgrep() function renamed to run_scan_and_return_json().
External tools (e.g., semgrep wrappers) using directly those functions
should be updated. Note that thi function will soon disappear as
part of a migration effort converting Python code to OCaml. Thus,
those tools should instead wrap the semgrep CLI and rely on
semgrep_output_v1.atd for a more stable official API.
