Fixed issue where conditional expressions aren't handled properly in expression based language.

Rust example:

Before:

```rust
fn expr_stmt_if(c) {
  y = 0;
  x = if c { y = 1 };

  // Before: this matches when it shouldn't because y is not always 1.
  // After: this does not match, which is the correct behavior.
  y == 1;
}
```
