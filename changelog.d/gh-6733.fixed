Fixed a typing issue with go; where semgrep with the pattern
'($VAR : *tau.rho).$F()` wouldn't produce a match in the
following:
```go
func f() {
  i_1 := &tau.rho{}
  i_2 := new(tau.rho)

  i_1.shift() //miss one
  i_2.left()  //miss two

  return 101
}
```
but now we don't miss those two findings!
