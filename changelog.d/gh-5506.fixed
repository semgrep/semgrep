Scala/others: Added a fix allowing percolation of name information from class parameters

For example, classes which take in arguments like the following in Scala:
```scala
class ExampleClass(val x: TypeName) {
}
```

do not properly enter the context. So in our analysis, we would not know that the identifier
`x` has type `TypeName`, within the body of `ExampleClass`.
