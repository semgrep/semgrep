Partially analyzed files are no longer reported as skipped by --verbose. And if we
lack info about what lines have been skipped we no longer report that all lines have
been skipped. That was not accurate. For example, an error while evaluating a
`metavariable-pattern` operator in one rule may cause a finding to be missed, and
the file being reported as partially analyzed. However, that error did not affect
any other rules, and even the affected rule may be able to produce some findings.
