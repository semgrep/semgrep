Fixed how the end positions assigned to metavariable bindings are computed, in
order to handle trailing newlines. This affected Semgrep's JSON output. If a
metavariable `$X` was bound to a piece of text containing a trailing newline,
such as "a\n", where the starting position was e.g. at line 1, Semgrep reported
that the end position was at line 2, when in fact the text is entirely within
line 1. If the text happened to be at the end of a file, Semgrep could report
an end position that was outside the bounds of the file.
