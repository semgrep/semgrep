Tainting: Parameters to functions in languages with pattern matching in function
arguments, such as Rust and OCaml, now transmit taint when they are sources.
This works with nested patterns too. For instance, in Rust:
```
fn f ((x, (y, z)): t) {
  let x = 2;
}
```
tainting the sole argument to this function will result in all of the identifiers
`x`, `y`, and `z` now being tainted.
