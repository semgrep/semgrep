Reduced the limits for the prefilter optimization so that rules that cause
computing the prefilter to blow up will abort more quickly. This improves
performance by 2-3 seconds for each of the slowest rules. May cause a
slowdown if a rule that previously could be filtered out no longer will be,
but based on testing this is unlikely.
