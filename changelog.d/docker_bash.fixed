[IMPORTANT] we restored bash, jq, and curl in our semgrep docker image as some
users were relying on it. We might remove them in the futur but in the
mean time we restored the packages and if we remove them we will announce
it more loudly. We will also create a new page giving more information
about our policy for our docker images.
