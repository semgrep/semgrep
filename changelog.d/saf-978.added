Added an experimental feature for users to use osemgrep to format
SARIF output.

When the flag --sarif and --use-osemgrep-format-output is specified,
semgrep will use the ocaml implementation to format SARIF.

This flag is experimental and can be removed any time. Users must not
rely on it being available.
