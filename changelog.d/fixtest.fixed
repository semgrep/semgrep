When using semgrep --test --json, we now report in the
config_missing_fixtests field in the JSON output not just rule files
containing a `fix:` without a corresponding ".fixed" test file; we now also
report rule files using a `fix-regex:` but without a corresponding a
.fixed test file, and the `fix:` or `fix-regex:` can be in
any rule in the file (not just the first rule).
