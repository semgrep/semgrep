Pro: Java: Semgrep is now able to track the propagation of taint from the
arguments of a method, to the object being called. So e.g. given a method

    public void foo(int x) {
        this.x = x;
    }

and a call `o.foo(tainted)`, Semgrep will be able to track that the field
`x` of `o` has been tainted.
