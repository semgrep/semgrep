Pro: Taint-mode now supports inter-procedural field-sensitivity for JS/TS.

For example, given this class:

```javascript
class Obj {
  constructor(x, y) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
  }
}
```

Semgrep knows that an object constructed by `new Obj("tainted", "safe")` has its
`x` attribute tainted, whereas its `y` attribute is safe.
