Adds support for a new flag, `--subdir <path>`, for `semgrep ci`, which allows users to pass a
subdirectory to scan instead of the entire directory. The path should be a relative path, and
the directory where `semgrep ci` is run should be the root of the repository being scanned.
Unless `SEMGREP_REPO_DISPLAY_NAME` is explicitly set, passing the subdirectory
will cause the results to go to a project specific to that subdirectory.

The intended use case for `semgrep ci --subdir path/to/dir` is to help users with very large
repos scan the repo in parts.
