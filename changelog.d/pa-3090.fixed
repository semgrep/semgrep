C++: Translate `for (T var : E)` loops into the Dataflow IL as for-each loops,
so that Semgrep reports no finding in the following code:

```
  for (int *p : set) {
    sink(p); // no finding
    source(p);
  }
```

Since each `p` is (in principle) a different object, even if `source(p)` taints
the current `p`, that should not affect the next one.
