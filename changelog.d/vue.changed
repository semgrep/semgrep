Removed support for Vue. The tree-sitter grammar has not been updated in 3 years,
there was no community rules added and semgrep-vue is causing linking conflicts
when compiling semgrep under Windows so just simpler to remove support for Vue.
In theory, extract mode could be a good substitute to parse Vue files.
