taint-mode: experimental: For now Semgrep CLI taint traces are not adapted to
support multiple labels, so Semgrep picks one arbitrary label to report, which
sometimes it's not the desired one. As a temporary workaround, Semgrep will
look at the `requires` of the sink, and if it has the shape `A and ...`, then
it will pick `A` as the preferred label and report its trace.
