We have reduced the default timeout (per-rule and per-file) to 2s (down from 30s).
Typically, running a rule on a file should take a fraction of a second. When a rule
takes more than a couple of seconds is often because the rule is not optimally
written, or because the file is unusually large (a minified file or machine-
generated code), so waiting 30s for it does not tend to bring any value. Plus, by
cutting it earlier, we may prevent a potential OOM crash when running the rule is
very memory intensive.
