The "package-lock.json" parser incorrectly assumed that all paths in the "packages" component of "package-lock.json" started with "node_modules/".

In reality, a dependency can be installed anywhere, so the parser was made more flexible to recognize alternative locations ("node_modules", "lib", etc).
