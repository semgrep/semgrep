For taint rules using labels (experimental) Semgrep now preferably picks a
source without `requires` for the taint trace

Semgrep now prioritizes taint sources without `requires` condition when
choosing a representative taint trace from multiple source traces. This helps
users to more clearly identify the initial taint source when multiple traces
are involved.
