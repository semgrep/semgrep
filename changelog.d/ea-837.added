Rule syntax: Metavariables by the name of `$_` are now _anonymous_, meaning that
they do not unify within a single pattern or across patterns, and essentially
just unconditionally specify some expression.

For instance, the pattern `foo($_, $_)` may match the code `foo(1, 2)`.

This will change the behavior of existing rules that use the metavariable
`$_`, if they rely on unification still happening. This can be fixed by simply
giving the metavariable a real name like `$A`.
