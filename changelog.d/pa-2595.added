Pro Engine: Semgrep CLI will now download a version of Semgrep Pro Engine
compatible with the current version of Semgrep CLI, as opposed to the most
recently released version.

This behavior is only supported for Semgrep 1.12.1 and later. Previous
versions will still download the most recently released version, as before.
