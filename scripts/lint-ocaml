# be hard to fix, because different versions of ocamlformat have conflicting
# indentation rules. That is why we need to pin and use everywhere the

# Note that sometimes we use the same ocamlformat version, and there

# In case of problems in CI, uncomment the #to debug: lines below.
# That way you can know which files were reformated in CI.
# Note however that the pre-commit CI action may loop forever if
# you leave those commands uncommented (no idea why, go figure again).
