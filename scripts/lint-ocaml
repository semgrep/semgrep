# Note that if the version of ocamlformat you use locally and the one
# used in CI differ, you will get your PR rejected by CI and it will
# be hard to fix, because different versions of ocamlformat have conflicting
# indentation rules. That is why we need to pin and use everywhere the
# same exact version.

# Note that sometimes we use the same ocamlformat version, and there
# are still problems ... go figure.
# In case of problems in CI, uncomment the #to debug: lines below.
# That way you can know which files were reformated in CI.
# Note however that the pre-commit CI action may loop forever if
# you leave those commands uncommented (no idea why, go figure again).

If you wish to re-indent OCaml code, you must install ocamlformat, which is
normally done with the following command:

  $ opam install ocamlformat

For now, let's pretend everything is fine.
