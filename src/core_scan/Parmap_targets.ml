     Sorting the targets by decreasing size is based on the assumption
     that larger targets will take more time to process. Starting with
     the longer jobs allows parmap to feed the workers with shorter and
     shorter jobs, as a way of maximizing CPU usage.
     This is a kind of greedy algorithm, which is in general not optimal
     but hopefully good enough in practice.

     This is needed only when ncores > 1, but to reduce discrepancy between
     the two modes, we always sort the target queue in the same way.

    (*
       Parmap creates ncores children processes which listen for
       chunks of input. When a chunk size is specified, parmap feeds
       the ncores processes in small chunks of the specified size
       instead of just dividing the input list into exactly ncores chunks.

       Since our jobs are relatively big compared to the serialization
       and communication overhead, setting the chunk size to 1 works
       fine.  We don't want to have two giant target files in the same
       chunk, so this setting takes care of it.

    (* Quoting Parmap's README:
     * > To obtain maximum speed, Parmap tries to pin the worker processes to a CPU
     * Unfortunately, on the new Apple M1, and depending on the number of workers,
     * Parmap will enter an infinite loop trying (but failing) to pin a worker to
     * CPU 0. This only happens with HomeBrew installs, presumably because under
     * HomeBrew's build environment HAVE_MACH_THREAD_POLICY_H is set
     * (https://github.com/rdicosmo/parmap/blob/1.2.3/src/setcore_stubs.c#L47).
     * So, despite it may hurt perf a bit, we disable core pinning to work around
     * this issue until this is fixed in a future version of Parmap.
