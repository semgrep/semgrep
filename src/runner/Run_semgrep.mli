 * # Notes
 *
 * ## semgrep CLI (a.k.a. pysemgrep) vs semgrep core
 *
 * Officially, `semgrep-core` is never run on its own. External users run
 * `semgrep`, which invokes `semgrep-core` with the appropriate rules and targets.
 * However, for development purposes it can be convenient to skip the wrapper.
 * Therefore, we also maintain some code paths that allow `semgrep-core` to take
 * in rules or patterns and perform its own file targeting. These will not always
 * return the same results as the equivalent `semgrep` run. To see valid inputs to
 * `semgrep-core`, see `semgrep-core --help`.
 *
 * When invoked by `semgrep`, `semgrep-core` will always be passed `-rules` and
 * `-targets`. All the code relevant to `semgrep` runs will be found in branches
 * where the rules file and the targets file are not `""`.
 *
 * While the `rules` file is just the collection of rules, the `targets` file
 * describes the mapping of targets to rules. See `targets` in `Input_to_core.atd`
 * for a description of its schema. `semgrep-core` follows the target-to-rule
 * mappings without validation or filtering.
 *
 * ## Performance
 *
 * The main components of performance can generally be broken down into:
 *
 * - rule parse time
 * - target parse time
 * - match time
 *   - pattern match time
 *   - formula evaluation time
 *
 * The `-json_time` output includes timings for the three broad components. In
 * general (at least at the time this was written), target parsing takes the
 * longest. Matching does not usually take long, though it can when there are
 * many general patterns (e.g. `$X`) that require going deep (e.g. multiple `...`
 * or `<... $X ...>`). Also, getting the range of a large sub-AST can be slow
 * because it requires collecting all the tokens in that sub-AST. Most of the
 * rules that take longest are generic rules, however, because they run on
 * every file.
 *
 * ## Memory usage
 *
 * Semgrep uses memory liberally. The main components of memory usage can
 * generally be broken down into:
 *
 * - rule parsing
 * - targets file parsing
 *   - in addition to saving the targets, we seem to keep around the
 *     buffer used to parse it
 * - running each target (this should not accumulate)
 *   - parsing the target
 *   - saving the pattern results
 *   - collecting the output for each target
 *   - other memory used while matching
 * - saving the output for each target
 * - some unknown accumulation that happens while running targets but goes
 *   away if we run `Gc.full_major` after each target
 * - creating the final output
 *
 * Of these, the memory used by rule parsing and targets file parsing has an
 * outsized impact on the memory used by multi-process runs because those two
 * structures are used by every process. (They are only read from, but they
 * end up getting copied into the process during garbage collection.) In
 * particular, the targets file is O(num_rules \* num_targets).
 *
 * If we need to reduce memory further, some options include:
 *
 * - Reduce memory used by rule parsing? (Have not investigated but from my
 *   personal profiling this seems too high)
 * - Further streamline the targets file and fix the problem with the buffer
 * - Investigate the unknown accumulation
 * - Compress non-necessary output (namely, `-json_time` is passed by default)
 * - Stream the outputs instead of collecting them and outputting them at the
 *   end
 *
 * For profiling, a useful module is `mem_usage`. See physical memory used in
 * total and by each object with:
 *
 * ```ocaml
 * let phys_mem () = Mem_usage.prettify_bytes (Mem_usage.((info ()).process_physical_memory))
 * let obj_size o = Mem_usage.prettify_bytes (Obj.reachable_words (Obj.repr o) * 8)
 * ```
 *
 * Note that `obj_size` may inadvertently prevent an object from being freed.
 *
 * Additionally, OCaml provides `Spacetime` for certain compilers. It works best
 * on Linux machines.
 *
 * We also have had stack overflows. OCaml <=4.14.0, we avoided this using
 * `Common.map`, which is tail-recursive, instead of `List.map`.
