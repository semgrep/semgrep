(* this can be raised when timeout_threshold is set *)
exception File_timeout of Rule_ID.t list

(* Matches many rules against one target. This function is called from
 * Test_engine.ml, Test_subcommand.ml, and of course Core_scan.ml
 * (and also Match_extract_mode.ml now).
 *
 * [dependency_match_table]: if the target had an associated lockfile, then
 * this is a mapping from supply chain rules to the dependencies they matched
 * in that lockfile.
 * It's used to annotate pattern matches with dependency matches.
 * alt: we could do this as part of the match_hook, but it would require:
 *   - to make the dependency_match field of a Pattern_match.t
 *     mutable, but this is minor.
 *   - it's currently possible for dependency matches to turn a single
 *     pattern match into *multiple* pattern matches,
 *     and match_hook cannot do this since it does not have access to the
 *     list of pattern matches produced by a rule.
 *     See: [annotate_pattern_match] in Match_dependency.mli
 *
 * Return matches, errors, and match time.
 *
 * This will run the search-mode and taint-mode rules.
 * !This can also raise File_timeout!
