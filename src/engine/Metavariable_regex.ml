             its source file is.

             This is because we produce positions within the regex matcher, and
             these positions call `line_col_of_charpos` relative to the charpos
             within the metavariable's contents, and not its position within the
             file.

             So for instance, in the program foo(bar) if our metavariable matches
             `bar`, we would try to get the line/col of charpos 0, even though the
             character `b` should have charpos 4.

             So we carry a base offset of the metavariable's start, so that we can
             perform that calculation.
