#
# How to update this file
# =======================
#
# When adding a new dependency, you may need to update this file. This is
# required when additional objects must be linked. Examples include: a new
# language using tree-sitter, a package with C bindings or system dependency.
#
# - If you are adding a new LANGUAGE (using tree-sitter):
#
#   - In the macosx case below, add the language name in the LANGS array.
#
#   - Other cases should not typically require changes.
#
#
# - If you are adding a new OCAML PACKAGE:
#
#   - In the macosx case below, add any STUBS the library relies on. These are
#     normally called something like <LIBRARY>_stubs. The name can be found in
#     the package's dune file as the value of the `names` field of the
#     `foreign_stubs` field under the library.
#
#   - In the macosx case below, add any SYSTEM LIBRARIES the library relies on.
#     This would be anything you needed to add to BREW_DEPS or have as a
#     conf-lib<SYSLIB> opam dependency.
#
#     If it would be installed by `brew`, specify the path using pkg-config
#     (see, e.g., gmp), or, if the package doesn't include a .pc file, use the
#     brew prefix. In these cases, you should specifically specify the static
#     archive (`.a`).
#
#   - Other cases should not typically require changes. If you have made
#     non-standard changes to the Dockerfile or Alpine build (e.g., building a
#     library from source), Alpine may require tweaks.

    # In general, we want to statically link to make it easier to distribute
    # binaries since they won't carry runtime dependencies on various
    # libraries which would need to be separately installed or managed.
    # Additionally, this can be a bit fragile depending on which paths the
    # loader uses, and where dylibs are expected to be (and how possible
    # differences in the CI build versus other environments).
    #
    # However, on MacOS, it is a bit difficult to ensure libraries are linked
    # statically. It is not possible to link all libraries statically.
    # Notably, libSystem cannot (officially) be statically linked against,
    # since MacOS does not have a stable syscall ABI, but rather relies on
    # libSystem being stable. See, e.g.,
    # - <https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/706419>
    # - <https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/qa/qa1118/_index.html>
    # - `man 1 ld`
    #
    # As a result, we cannot use a similar strategy to our Alpine build (which
    # works for Linux, since it is a rare case with a stable syscall ABI, See
    # <https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/473137/do-other-unix-like-kernels-have-stable-syscall-abis>).
    # Previously we relied on a workaround where we deleted the `.dylib`
    # versions of libraries, leaving only the `.a` versions, thus forcing them
    # to be linked statically. However, this breaks the build in the case
    # where later build steps require programs which dynamically linked
    # against those libraries. Notably, this occurs for PCRE2. See
    # <https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep/pull/10064>.
    #
    # One might hope that we could specify the linker to use the `.a` version
    # without deleting the `.dylib`, but the only way to do this is to disable
    # autolinking and specify each library individually. Otherwise, on MacOS,
    # if both are present, the linker will link dynamically regardless.
    #
    # If you add a dependency which should be statically linked, it should be
    # added to this list. If it has a `.pc` file, ensure that the library is
    # appropriately added to PKG_CONFIG_PATH and use pkg-config to pick it up
    # below (see, e.g., gmp). If we expect it to always be installed via brew,
    # then use `brew --prefix <BREW PACKAGE NAME>`.
