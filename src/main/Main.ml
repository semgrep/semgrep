(* Entry point *)
(*****************************************************************************)

(* We currently use a single binary for semgrep-core and osemgrep. This
 * binary is called 'semgrep-core' and is accompanied by a symlink
 * to semgrep-core called 'osemgrep' (see 'make core').
 * We use the argv[0] trick below to decide whether the user wants the
 * semgrep-core or osemgrep behavior.
 * alt: we could have provided a separate binary for osemgrep, which
 * would be cleaner, but that would double the size of our Docker image.
 * LATER: when osemgrep is fully done we can just get rid of semgrep-core
 * and rename this binary to simply 'semgrep'.
