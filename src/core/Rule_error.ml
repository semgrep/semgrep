(* Rule errors, mostly created during rule parsing. Those errors can be
 * divided in two categories: "recoverable" and "fatal" errors.
 * TODO: what about "skippable" errors, a subcategory of "recoverable"?
 *
 * A recoverable error is one that does not prevent to parse the rest of
 * the file containing the rules. For example, a rule containing a bad
 * language. This leads to split rules in regular fully-parsed rules, and
 * invalid rules where we only remember the rule ID and position.
 *
 * history: used to be in Rule.ml but this file was getting really big.

    You must provide a rule ID for a rule to be reported properly as an invalid
    rule.
    TODO: make the argument not optional because it's important to not forget
    to specify a rule ID whenever possible? It was originally but pad
    refactored the code but maybe we should revert that part and restore
    ~rule_id instead of ?rule_id

    It's not great that we set this temporary file below, but because of how we
    guard `Parse_rule`, this should definitely be populated in any entry point
   functions other than `parse_xpattern` and `parse_fake_xpattern`.

   alt: we could try to provide the `file` at each call-site of
   `mk_error` itself, such as in the `Parse_rule_helpers.env`. This is actually
   a pretty hard refactor, though, as not all of those call-sites have easy
   access to a file or an env.
   For instance, yaml_error calls Rule.Error.mk_error, but yaml_error is
   explicitly called by take_no_env. We can't thread an env through there,
   the point is that it doesn't take an env, so we would need to do a broader
   refactor. This will do to start, as I anticipate we probably won't be
   refactoring this module to add more entry points at any time.
