(* TODO(dinosaure): Currently, on the Python side, we remove the metadatas and
   serialise the rule into JSON format, then produce the hash from this
   serialisation. However, there is no way (yet?) to serialise OCaml [Rule.t]s
   into JSON format. It exists, however, a path where we should be able to
   serialize a [Rule.t] via [ppx] (or by hands). It requires more work because
   we must have a way to serialize all types required by [Rule.t] but the
   propagation of a [ppx] such as [ppx_deriving.show] demonstrates that it's
   possible to implement such function.

   Actually, we tried to use [Marshal] and produce a hash from the /marshalled/
   output but [Rule.t] contains some custom blocks that the [Marshal] module can
   not handle.

   Currently, we did the choice to **only** hash the [ID.t] of the given rule
   which is clearly not enough comparing to the Python code. But, again, we can
   improve that by serialize everything and compute a hash from it. *)
