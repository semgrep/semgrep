(* Types for type inference.
 *
 * Why not simply reuse AST_generic.type_ ? Because here we want to make
 * sure type names are fully resolved! AST_generic is also meant to represent
 * types that people could actually write as part of programs. This is a more
 * abstract representation of types, divorced from the notion of a syntax tree.
 * For example, we don't include tokens here. We may introduce types here that
 * wouldn't appear as written types in a program. We might even introduce type
 * variables here, which would not be appropriate to include in AST_generic.
 *
 * In the future, we may also want to apply more complex normalizations to
 * simplify typing/naming.
 *
 * TODO: polymorphic types? type parameters are resolved names?
 *
 * These types are polymorphic to support the Pro Engine, which represents
 * resolved names differently.
