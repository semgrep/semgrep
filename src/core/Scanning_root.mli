   A dedicated type for Semgrep scanning roots to avoid confusion with

(*
   The type of a scanning root.

   A scanning root is a file or a folder that exists. It may be absolute
   or relative to the current working directory. It may be a symbolic
   link, in which case it will be dereferenced when scanning for target files.

   Note that resolving symlinks may be done only after figuring out the
   project root, otherwise the project root would be inferred incorrectly.
