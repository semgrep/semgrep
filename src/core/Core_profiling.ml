(* Profiling information on rule matching and target parsing.
 *
 * Many of the types below are created to collect profiling information in as
 * well-typed a manner as possible. Creating a type for practically every
 * stage that reports matches is annoying, but prevents us from relying on
 * dummy values or unlabeled tuples.
 *
 * Note that the extra information can take a lot of memory, which scales
 * with both the number of rules and files. On large repos, this used to
 * be (and may still be) the most significant factor driving semgrep's
 * memory consumption. Therefore, if the parsing times (for example) are
 * not being used, we don't want to save them.
 *
 * Like for Core_error.ml and Core_result.ml, this "core" profiling
 * is eventually converted in semgrep_output_v1.core_timing,
 * which is then transformed in ProfilingData in profiling.py and
 * finally transformed in a semgrep_output_v1.profile type.
 * There's also Profiler.ml in osemgrep, and poor man profiler
 * stuff in libs/profiling/profiling.ml accessed via --profile
 * LATER: remove some intermediate types.
