  (* w.r.t. hashing, these are just Generic ASTs, which can be rather large.
     Whereas `Hashtbl.hash` will hash only to a certain depth, because it
     is polymorphic, it will be sensitive to things like tokens, which should
     be ignored by the hash function.
     The generated hash function for Generic ASTs will be rather hefty though,
     for the above reasoning. So we will choose to just decline to hash
     the generic AST.
