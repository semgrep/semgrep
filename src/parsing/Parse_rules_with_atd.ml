(* Experiment to parse rules using semgrep-interfaces/rule_schema_v2.atd
 * instead of Parse_rule.ml or even rule_schema_v1.yaml
 *
 * See the comment in rule_schema_v2.atd for more info.
 *
 * Note that ATD by default does error recovery on variant names it does not
 * know or field names it does not know. However, for schema validation we
 * actually want to raise errors, hence the use of -j-strict-fields in
 * src/core/dune when compiling rule_schema_v2.atd.
