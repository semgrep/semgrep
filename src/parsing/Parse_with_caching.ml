(*****************************************************************************)
(* Purpose *)
(*****************************************************************************)
(* Cache parsed generic ASTs between two runs of Semgrep to speedup things.
 *
 * On some big repositories (e.g., elasticsearch), the speedup can be
 * very important (e.g., 10x). Indeed:
 *  $ time semgrep-core -l java -rules ~/eqeq.yaml ~/elasticsearch/
 *  real: 1m22s
 *  $ time semgrep-core -use_parsing_cache ~/.semgrep/cache -l java -rules ~/eqeq.yaml ~/elasticsearch/
 *  real: 0.11s
 *
 * history: the cache used to be necessary because pysemgrep was
 * making multiple calls to semgrep-core and we didn't want to reparse again
 * the same file for each rule. After migrating the processing of all
 * the rules at once to semgrep-core, this was not needed anymore. However,
 * it is now useful again to speedup semgrep when running semgrep
 * multiple times on the same repository. This can also be useful
 * for semgrep LSP.
 *
 * This file could also be under optimizing/, but that would require to add
 * semgrep_parsing as a dependency in optimizing/dune.
 *)

(*****************************************************************************)
(* Types *)
(*****************************************************************************)

(* We store the parsed AST and the skipped tokens in the cache. If parsing
 * was resulting in an exception, we store the exn instead.
 * The extra data is to double check the cached AST correspond
 * to the file, to check it has the right AST_generic.version, and
 * to check if the cache is stale.
 * We use Rpath below instead of Fpath which reduces cache miss if
 * some people are running Semgrep from different places or through
 * symlinks.
