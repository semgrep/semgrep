(* Depending on the variant, these may or may not be "recoverable" or
   "unrecoverable", where "recoverable" errors in rule parsing can simply skip
   the rule, whereas "unrecoverable" rule errors will stop engine execution.

   We make this private, because we have since decided to include a file path
   with each rule error, by intercepting the error before it exits rule parsing.

   To clean the code, we establish a singular way to create an error, that being
   `mk_error`, so that we are not too dependent on the definition of the type.
   This also lets us instantiate the `file` at a dummy value uniformly.
