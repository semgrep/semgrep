(* NOTE "Top matches":
 * (See note "Taint-tracking via ranges" in 'Match_tainting_mode.ml' for context.)
 *
 * We use sub-range checks to determine whether a piece of code is a source/sink/etc,
 * and this can lead to unintuitive results. For example,
 *
 *     sink(if tainted then ok1 else ok2)
 *
 * was reported as a tainted sink despite `if tainted then ok1 else ok2` is actually
 * not tainted. The problem was that `tainted` is inside what `sink(...)` matches,
 * and using a sub-range check we end up considering `tainted` itself as a sink.
 *
 * Unfortunately simply checking for exact matches is fragile, because sometimes we
 * are not able to match sources/sinks/etc exactly. For example, if you want
 * `echo ...;` to be a sink in PHP, you cannot omit the ';' as `echo` is not an
 * expression. But in the IL, `echo` is represented as a `Call` instruction and
 * the ';' is not part of the`iorig`.
 *
 * So, given a source/sink/etc specification, we check whether the spec matches
 * any of the top-level nodes in the CFG (see 'IL.node_kind'). Given two matches,
 * if one is contained inside the other, then we consider them the same match and
 * we take the larger one as the canonical. We store the canonical matches in a
 * 'Top_matches' data structure, and we use these "top matches" matches as a
 * practical definition of what an "exact match" is.
 *
 * For example, if the sink specification is `echo ...;`, and the code we have is
 * `echo $_GET['foo'];`, then this method will determine that `echo $_GET['foo']`
 * is the best match we can get, and that becomes the definition of exact. Then,
 * when we check whether an expression or instruction is a sink, if its range is a
 * strict sub-range of one of these top matches, we simply disregard it (because it
 * is not an exact match). In our example above the top sink match will be
 * `sink(if tainted then ok1 else ok2)`, so we will disregard `tainted` as a sink
 * because we know there is a better match.
