type overlap = float

 * perfectly. For example, if `foo(...)` is a source spec, `foo(x)` would be
 * a perfect match, whereas the `x` in `foo(x)` would match the spec but loosely
 * (see note on "Taint-tracking via ranges" in 'Match_tainting_mode'.)

 * In practice we interpret >0.99 as being the same as 1.0, see 'is_exact'. *)

(** In general we cannot guarantee truly exact (see 'is_exact') matches, e.g. some
 * token may have been "lost" or something in the Generic-to-IL translation. Since
 * we cannot rely on the 'overlap', we instead look for the "top-level" nodes in
 * the CFG, and record whether they match any taint spec in this data structure.
 * If one match is contained in another one, we only keep the _larges_ match.
 * For example, given `foo(...)` then `foo(x)` will be recorded as a top-level
 * match, whereas `foo` or `x` will not. *)
