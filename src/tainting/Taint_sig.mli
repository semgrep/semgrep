(** A (polymorphic) taint signature: simply a set of results for a function.
 *
 * Note that this signature is polymorphic/context-sensitive given that the
 * potential taints coming into the function via its arguments are represented
 * by 'lval' taints, that can be instantiated as needed.
 *
 * For example given:
 *
 *     def foo(x):
 *         sink(x.a)
 *
 * We infer the signature (simplified):
 *
 *     {ToSink {taints_with_precondition = [(x#0).a]; sink = ... ; ...}}
 *
 * where '(x#0).a' is taint variable that denotes the taint of the offset `.a`
 * of the parameter `x` (where '#0' means it is the first argument) of `foo`.
 * The signature tells us that '(x#0).a' will reach a sink.
 *
 * Given a concrete call `foo(obj)`, Semgrep will instantiate this signature with
 * taint assigned to `obj.a` in that calling context. If it is tainted, then
 * Semgrep will report a finding.
 *
 * Also note that, within each function, if there are multiple paths through
 * which a taint source may reach a sink, we do not keep all of them but only
 * the shortest one.
 *
 * THINK: Could we have a "taint shape" for functions/methods ?
