       *         return a2b(x)

       * we will determine that the taint of `a2b(x)` is `B` *conditional to*

       * Taint variables are introduced by variables that are in the scope of
       * a function/method definition, and that are considered like "inputs"
       * or parameters. We identify the variables with the l-value from which
       * they originate. For example given:
       *
       *     def foo(x):
       *       return x.a
       *
       * We assign `x` the taint variable `x` too, that is:
       *
       *     { base = BArg {name = "x"; index = 0}; offset = [] }
       *
       * And `x.a` would be another taint variable resulting from adding the
       * offset `.a` to the taint of `x`, that is:
       *
       *     { base = BArg {name = "x"; index = 0}; offset = [Ofld "a"] }
       *
       * It is then trivial to instantiate taint variables, for a concrete call.
       * If we encounter a call `foo(obj)`, we can easily compute the taint
       * returned by that function by 1) subtituting `x` with `obj` thus obtaining
       * the l-value `obj.a`, and 2) looking up the taint attached to `obj.a` in
       * the environment.
