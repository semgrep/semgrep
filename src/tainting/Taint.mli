 *
 * Also note that, within each function, if there are multiple paths through
 * which a taint source may reach a sink, we do not keep all of them but only
 * the shortest one.
 *
 * For example given:
 *
 *     def foo(x):
 *         sink(x.a)
 *
 * We infer a signature that states (via a `ToSink` finding) that whatever
 * taints come via the `.a` field of the argument `x` of `foo`, denoted by an
 * 'arg' taint "variable", will reach the `sink`. So, when `foo(x)` is called in
 * a context where the actual argument for `x` has it's `.a` field tainted,
 * Semgrep will instantiate this signature and report a finding.
 *
 * THINK: We could use a type-and-effect language to represent taint sigantures,
 * e.g.
 *
 *     forall 'a. {x: 'a} -{ sink('a) }-> unit
 *
