(* Taint analysis *)
(*****************************************************************************)

(* We need to set some limits to prevent taint sets from exploding in some cases.
 * As we root cause these problems and fix them properly, we may be able to raise
 * these limits.
 *
 * These problems became more serious with field-sensitivity: where previously we
 * would just track taint for `x`, now we track taint for `x.a`, `x.b` and `x.c`.
 *
 * In the case of 'WebGoat/src/main/resources/webgoat/static/js/libs/ace.js',
 * for example, it seems that this problem would be greatly reduced if we did
 * not propagate taint for data with Boolean and integer type. Improving some
 * of the data structures involved may help too.
