(* Handles AST printing for the purposes of autofix.
 *
 * The main printing logic happens elsewhere. This module's main purpose is to
 * extend the existing AST printers so that they can avoid printing AST nodes
 * which are lifted unchanged from either the target file (via metavariable
 * bindings) or the fix pattern in the rule. This serves two purposes:
 * - It lets us synthesize autofixes without having to implement printing for
 *   all of the AST nodes in the fixed AST.
 * - It lets us make minimal changes to target files by carrying over
 *   formatting, comments, etc. from the original code.
 *)
(******************************************************************************)

(* This lets us avoid the polymorphic hash function and polymorphic equality,
 * which will take into account extraneous information such as e_range, leading
 * to failed lookups. *)
