(* Test suite for the autofix printers.
 *
 * This runs Semgrep to get a pattern match, then renders the fix. However, it
 * feeds in fake strings for the target and fix pattern contents, so that we can
 * test which parts were lifted from the original source and which parts were
 * printed from scratch. This functionality is a key part of the autofix
 * printer, and this allows us to test that it is being done for all of the
 * nodes we expect.
 *
 * Even if our printers become excellent and handle nearly every case, we still
 * have no plans to include comments, mimic the original formatting, or do any
 * kind of nicely formatted pretty-printing. And, there is always the
 * possibility of a bug in the printer. For these reasons, it's important that
 * we minimize the amount of printing we have to do by lifting the original text
 * wherever possible. However, it's not obvious in ordinary autofix tests where
 * the text in the rendered fix came from. So, it would be easy to miss a bug
 * that led to a particular node getting printed from scratch rather than lifted
 * from the original text.
 *
 * This does not test that we lift the correct ranges from the original target
 * or fix pattern, just that we lift the correct number of characters. The tests
 * in `tests` exercise the system as a whole, and ensure that the
 * fixes tested there are correct.
