(*****************************************************************************)
(* Analyzing a semgrep pattern for optimization purpose.
 *
 * It is useless to run the semgrep engine with rules containing specific
 * identifiers (e.g., 'eval') or strings (e.g., 'react.js')
 * that are never mentioned in the target file.
 *
 * We did something similar in Coccinelle I think. This also has been
 * mentioned many times (by Clint, HN, etc.).
 *
 * Right now the main optimization is to extract a regexp from
 * a pattern that we can run first on the target file.
 *
 * This module is currently used by:
 *  - Mini_rules_filter and Semgrep_generic, to skip certain mini-rules
 *    (but not entire files)
 *  - the bloom filter pattern extractor of Nathan and Emma
 *  - the Semgrep.ml engine to skip entire files!
 *
 * TODO:
 *  - extract identifiers, and basic strings
 *  - TODO extract filenames in import
 *)

(* TODO(iago): This is partly redundant with Bloom_annotation.statement_strings,
 * it might be more maintainable if we had a single visitor that worked for both
 * statements and patterns. *)
