(* A prefilter is a pair containing a function
 * that when applied to the content of a file will return whether
 * or not we should process the file. False means that we can
 * skip the file (or more accurately, it means we can skip this rule
 * for this file, and if there are no more rules left for this target file,
 * we will entirely skip the file because we now parse files lazily).
 *)
type prefilter = Semgrep_prefilter_t.formula * (string -> bool)

(* This function analyzes a rule and returns optionaly a prefilter.
 *
 * The return prefilter relies on a formula of
 * regexps that we try to extract from the rule. For example, with:
 *   pattern-either: foo()
 *   pattern-either: bar()
 *
 * we will extract the 'foo|bar' regexp, and the returned function
 * will check whether this regexp matches the content of a file.
 *
 * This function returns None when it was not able to extract
 * a formula of regexps (it bailed out), which can happen because
 * the formula is too general (e.g., pattern: $XX($YY)).
 * In that case, None is really the same than returning a function
 * that always return true (which means we should analyze the target file).
 *
 * Note that this function use Common.memoized on the rule id
