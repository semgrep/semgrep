(*
   Track the location of the leftmost and rightmost matched statements,
   when matching a sequence a statements.

   This is not a problem for other types of patterns (expressions, ...),
   which match a single node rather than a sequence.

   Here's the problem:
   We match lists of statements that can either be actual sequences
   of statements in the AST, or a flattened sub-AST. It's for the latter
   that the situation is messy, as some stmts in the list may contain
   other list members, and the rightmost element in the list is not
   necessarily the rightmost element in the source code e.g.
   the source code

     {
       foo();
     }

   is flattened into a Block statement ({ ... }) and an expression statement
   (foo();). If this code matches the pattern, the location of the match
   must include the closing '}'. However, the rightmost token in the source
   is not part of the rightmost statement in the list. Additionally,
   extracting the rightmost location in a given statement is a bit expensive,
   so we want to do this only once we have full match. Until then, we
   simply accumulate the statements into a list whose order doesn't matter,
   and we search for the rightmost location and leftmost location.

   Now there's an issue with caching, in which we cache the result of
   matching the rest of a pattern with the rest of the target AST node.
   When hitting the cache, the result we get back is a full match in which
   the rightmost location is reliable. However, the leftmost location is
   not reliable because the left part of the pattern or source code
   is different from what was seen before (otherwise it would likely
   have been cached and retrieved from the cache). So, the leftmost location
   is given by one set of matching statements and the rightmost location is
   given by another set of matching statements, the one found in the cache.
   This is why we accumulate two sets of statements:
   - left_stmts
   - right_stmts

(* Leftmost and rightmost statements matched by the pattern.
   They're used to determine the matched region when the pattern
   matches a sequence of statements. See details in the big comment above.
