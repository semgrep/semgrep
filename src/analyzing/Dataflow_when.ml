(* Support for pattern-when, allowing for control flow-related comparisons.
 * This code is behind -path_sensitive flag which sets hook_path_sensitive below.
 *
 * Example usage:
 *
 * rules:
 * - id: patten-when
 *   match:
 *   pattern: foo($X);
 *   where:
 *    - comparison: $X == 0
 * ...
 *
 * if (x == NULL) {
 *    // ok
 *    foo(x);
 * } else {
 *    // ruleid: patten-when
 *    foo(x);
 * }

(* Types *)

(* facts: a type defined in AST_generic. it represents known truths about
 * an expression, derived from control flow constructs.
 *
 * ctx: a type used only in this file. it's a stack of facts representing
 * the state (facts we know) at different levels in a cfg (hd of list =
 * top of stack).
 *
 * for example, if we have the following code:
 *
 * if (x == 0) {
 *    // A
 *    ...
 *    if (y == 0) {
 *      // B
 *      ...
 *    }
 * }
 *
 * the facts would be x == 0 and y == 0. the ctx at A would be [[x == 0]],
 * the ctx at B would be [[y == 0]; [x == 0]].
 *)

 * }
 *
 * we will call the visitor with the fact x == 0 and recursively
 * annotate x + x and the two x's with the fact.

(* this function add facts onto nodes in a cfg based on conditional constructs by
 * keeping track of a context, called ctx, which stores a list of facts representing
 * the state of facts at different levels (see type definition above).
 *
 * in the cfg, any conditional construct is deconstructed into NCond, TrueNode, FalseNode,
 * Join, and other nodes.
 *
 * when we encounter a TrueNode/ FalseNode (i.e. going down a level),
 * we will combine the new assumptions (based on the guard) and the existing facts
 * to create a new fact list, which is pushed into the context.
 *
 * when we encounter a Join, we know that we are going outside of the current conditional
 * construct (i.e. going up a level), so we will pop the top-level facts from the context.
 *
 * for the other nodes, we make them inherit their parent's facts in the cfg and
 * continue propagating the facts via the context.
