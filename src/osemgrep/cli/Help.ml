(* Help messages for 'semgrep --help' and just 'semgrep'.
 *
 * python: the help message was automatically generated by Click
 * based on the docstring and the subcommands. In OCaml we have to
 * generate it manually, but anyway we want full control of the help
 * message so this isn't too bad.
 *
 * LATER: add 'interactive' and 'test' new osemgrep-only
 * subcommands (not added yet to avoid regressions in tests/e2e/test_help.py).
