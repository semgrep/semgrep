   (O)Semgrep command-line entry point.

   This module determines the subcommand invoked on the command line
   and has another module handle it as if it was an independent command.
   Exceptions are caught and turned into an appropriate exit code
   (unless you used --debug).

   We don't use Cmdliner to dispatch subcommands because it's too
   complicated and anywant we want full control on main help message.

   Translated from cli.py and commands/wrapper.py

(* Constants *)
(*****************************************************************************)
(* python: the help message was automatically generated by Click
 * based on the docstring and the subcommands. In OCaml we have to
 * generate it manually, but anyway we want full control on the help
 * message so this isn't bad.
 * LATER: add 'interactive', 'test', 'validate', and 'dump' new osemgrep-only
 * subcommands (not added yet to avoid regressions in tests/e2e/test_help.py).

  {|Usage: semgrep [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  To get started quickly, run `semgrep scan --config auto`

  Run `semgrep SUBCOMMAND --help` for more information on each subcommand

  If no subcommand is passed, will run `scan` subcommand by default

Options:
  -h, --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  ci                   The recommended way to run semgrep in CI
  install-semgrep-pro  Install the Semgrep Pro Engine
  login                Obtain and save credentials for semgrep.dev
  logout               Remove locally stored credentials to semgrep.dev
  lsp                  [EXPERIMENTAL] Start the Semgrep LSP server
  publish              Upload rule to semgrep.dev
  scan                 Run semgrep rules on files
