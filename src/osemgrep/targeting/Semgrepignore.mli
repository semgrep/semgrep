(*
   Pass a path to a file and determine whether it should be ignored for
   Semgrep scanning purposes.

   The input path must be either absolute with the root '/' designating
   the root of the git project or relative to the project root.

   The input path doesn't have to exist. Directories are identified by
   a trailing slash. It's important since some *ignore patterns only apply
   to directories.

   Use Git_project.find_project_root to determine the root of the
   git project and obtain valid git paths (paths relative to the project root).
