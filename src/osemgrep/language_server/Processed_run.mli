(**  [of_matches ~only_git_dirty result] returns the list of cli matches from the
     result of a semgrep run. If [only_git_dirty] is [true], only the matches
     that are in files + lines that are git dirty are returned. If [git_ref] is set,
     then we will filter out matches that have been changed since that ref.
