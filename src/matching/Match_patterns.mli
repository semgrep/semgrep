(* This is the entry point function for matching/. check() below is called
 * from engine/ in Match_search_mode.matches_of_patterns, called itself
 * from Match_rules.check().
 *
 * Match many patterns (mini-rules) against one target file.
 *
 * @param range_filter A predicate that defines "regions of interest" when
 * matching expressions. This is e.g. used for optimizing `pattern: $X` by
 * filtering out any matches that are not within the ranges of preceding
 * `pattern-inside`s. Typically you will check that the range of the
 * expression is strictly inside your area(s) of interest, no need to
 * worry about sub-expressions, they will be visited regardless.
