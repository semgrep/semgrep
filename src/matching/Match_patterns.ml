 * to get a safe approximation of facts that must hold within a

 * this ensures we only consider facts that are true across all parts of

 * x == 0, we should only match the first for loop since all its
 * subexpressions (e.g. i < 5) would be annotated with the fact x == 0
 * (i.e. the intersection of its subexpressions' facts contains x == 0).

             Essentially, we would like users to be able to write patterns which
             look like sequences of fields, and can match to fields as well.

             Consider a Python example, of a class:
             ```
             class A:
               foo()
               bar()
             ```

             If we wanted to match any time where `bar()` came after `foo()`, we could
             not match with just the pattern
             ```
             foo()
             ...
             bar()
             ````
             because the latter is an Ss, and will only match to Ss, whereas the former
             is actually a class which contains Flds.

             So if someone writes a pattern which could be interpreted as a sequence of
             fields, we allow it to match to fields.
