(*
   Guess whether a given file is indeed written in the specified
   programming language.

   - uses file name, permissions, file contents
   - this is used to filter candidates for a given language
   - a given file may be in multiple languages

   This will exclude files we don't want to handle with semgrep, such
   as the '.min.js' files (JavaScript minified files which are not human-
   readable and usually really big) or '.d.ts' (TypeScript typed interfaces
   for which we don't have a parser).

   Split selected files (left) from excluded files (right).

(*
   Get the first 'block_size' bytes of the file, which is ideally obtained
   from a single filesystem block. 'block_size' defaults to 4096.

   This is intended for peeking into target file contents and finding out
   if it looks like it's in the desired format.
