   Command line options look like this:

     --include <PATTERN1> --include PATTERN2 SCANNING_ROOT

   This results in (Some [PATTERN1; PATTERN2]). It means that any path
   or subpath in SCANNING_ROOT or one of its children matching PATTERN1
   or PATTERN2 will be selected as valid scanning roots.
   Other paths will be filtered out.

   Example:

    file tree:

    a
    └── b
       ├── c
       └── d

    command: --include b/c a

    paths and subpaths to consider for selection:
    - /a
    - /a/b
    - /a/b/c
    - /a/b/d
    - a
    - a/b
    - a/b/c
    - a/b/d
    - b
    - b/c
    - b/d
    - c
    - d

    selected paths:
    - /a/b/c (via the subpath b/c matching the pattern b/c)

   The 'select' function below receives the path to a file within a project
   rather than a whole file tree. The selection is performed by breaking
   down the path into subpaths and matching them against the patterns.

   The path is selected if any of its subpaths matches any of the include
   patterns.
