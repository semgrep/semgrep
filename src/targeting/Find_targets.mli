(* Entry point used by osemgrep.

   Take a set of scanning roots which are files or folders (directories) and
   expand them into the set of files that could be targets for some
   rules. Return a list of deduplicated paths to regular files.

   If a scanning root is a symbolic link, it is dereferenced recursively
   until it results in a regular file or a directory. However, we
   don't follow symbolic links discovered when listing directories.

   The order of the files isn't guaranteed to be anything special
   at the moment but we could obey some ordering if it makes sense to do it
   here.

   This may raise Unix.Unix_error if the scanning root does not exist.
