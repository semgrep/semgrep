  message: >-
    These permissions `$BITS` are widely permissive and grant access
    to more people than may be necessary. A good default is `0o644` which
    gives read and write access to yourself and read access to everyone else.
  patterns:
    - pattern: os.$METHOD($FILE, $BITS, ...)
    - metavariable-comparison:
        metavariable: $BITS
        comparison: $BITS >= 0o650 and $BITS < 0o100000
