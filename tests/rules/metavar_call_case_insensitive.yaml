# TODO: This should still work if the pattern were the following, but it doesn't.
#- pattern: $X == $X
# The problem is that the metavariable equality as implemented in matching_generic.ml
# ends up calling the derived equality for the ast_generic.expr and that doesn't respect
# case insensitivity of names and it wasn't obvious how to fix that.
