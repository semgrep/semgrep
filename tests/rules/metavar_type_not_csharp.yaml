    Detected a direct write to the HTTP response. This bypasses any
    view or template environments, including HTML escaping, which may
    expose this application to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
    Consider using a view technology such as JavaServer Faces (JSFs) which
    automatically escapes HTML views.
