Matching diagnosis:
./test.py: Unexpected match at line 5:
    foo(good)
This match originated at this pattern at line 6 in ./test.yaml:
        - pattern: foo(...)
Maybe the match was supposed to be filtered out by one of these patterns?
  line 7:
          - not: foo(goood)
  line 5:

          - pattern: foo(...)
