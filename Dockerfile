# Overview
###############################################################################
# First, we build a fully *static* 'semgrep-core' binary on Alpine. This
# binary does not even depend on Glibc because Alpine uses Musl instead
# which can be statically linked.
#
# Then 'semgrep-core' alone is copied to another Alpine-based container
# which takes care of the 'semgrep-cli' (a.k.a. pysemgrep) Python wrapping.
#
# We use Alpine because it allows to generate the smallest Docker images.
# We use this two-steps process because *building* semgrep-core itself
# requires lots of tools (ocamlc, gcc, make, etc.), with big containers,
# but those tools are not necessary when *running* semgrep.
# This is a standard practice in the Docker world.
# See https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-stage/

###############################################################################
# Step0: collect files needed to build semgrep-cpre
###############################################################################

# The semgrep git repository contains the source code to multiple build artifacts
# (semgrep, semgrep-core, semgrep.js, etc...). In order to maximize Docker cache
# hits (and keep the build fast), we only copy over the folders needed to build
# semgrep-core. This is done in a multi-stage build so that the final COPY
# happens in a single layer.

FROM busybox:stable as semgrep-core-files
WORKDIR /src/semgrep

# copy over the entire semgrep repository
COPY . .

# remove files and folders that aren't necessary for the semgrep-core build
# coupling: see the (dirs ...) directive in the toplevel dune file for the list
# of directories containing OCaml code and which should not be added below
# (except js/ which contains OCaml code but is not used to build semgrep-core)
RUN rm -rf cli js .github .circleci Dockerfile

# we *do* need the cli's semgrep_interfaces folder, however
COPY cli/src/semgrep/semgrep_interfaces cli/src/semgrep/semgrep_interfaces

###############################################################################
# Step1: build semgrep-core
###############################################################################

# The Docker image below (after the 'FROM') is prepackaged with 'ocamlc',
# 'opam', and lots of packages that are used by semgrep-core and installed in
# the 'make install-deps' command further below.
# See https://github.com/returntocorp/ocaml-layer/blob/master/configs/alpine.sh
# for this list of packages.
# Thanks to this container, 'make install-deps' finishes very quickly because it's
# mostly a noop. Alternative base container candidates are:
#
#  - 'ocaml/opam:alpine', the official OCaml/opam Docker image,
#    but building our Docker image would take longer because
#    of all the necessary Semgrep dependencies installed in 'make install-deps'.
#
#    We build a new Semgrep Docker image on each pull-request (PR) so we don't
#    want to wait 30min each time just for 'docker build' to finish.
#
#    Note also that ocaml/opam:alpine default user is 'opam', not 'root', which
#    is not without problems when used inside Github actions (GHA) or even inside
#    this Dockerfile.
#
#    update: we recently started to cache the ~/.opam/ directory in CI so
#    in theory we could get rid of ocaml-layer and instead use the official
#    opam docker image combined with this ~/.opam/ caching to speedup things.
#
#  - 'alpine', the official Alpine Docker image, but this would require some
#    extra 'apk' commands to install opam, and extra commands to setup OCaml
#    with this opam from scratch, and more importantly this would take
#    far more time to finish. Moreover, it is not trivial to work from such
#    a base container as 'opam' itself requires lots of extra
#    tools like gcc, make, which are not provided by default on Alpine.
#
# An alternative to ocaml-layer would be to use https://depot.dev/
# update: we actually started to use depot.dev to speedup multi-arch (arm)
# docker image, so maybe we could use it to get rid of ocaml-layer
#
# Note that the Docker base image below currently uses OCaml 4.14.0
# coupling: if you modify the OCaml version there, you probably also need
# to modify:
# - scripts/{osx-setup-for-release,setup-m1-builder}.sh
# - doc/SEMGREP_CORE_CONTRIBUTING.md
# - https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/semgrep.rb
#
# coupling: if you modify the FROM below, you probably need to modify also
# a few .github/workflows/ files. grep for returntocorp/ocaml there.

# - bash, curl, jq: various utilities useful in CI jobs (e.g., our benchmark jobs,
