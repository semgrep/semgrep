# Semgrep Privacy Policy

Semgrep may collect non-identifiable aggregate metrics to help improve the product. This document describes:

* the principles that guide our data-collection decisions
* how to opt-in to Semgrep’s metrics
* the breakdown of the data that are and are not collected
* how we use the data to make Semgrep better

## Principles

These principles inform our decisions around data collection:

1. **Transparency**: Collect and use data in a way that is clearly explained to the user and benefits them
2. **User control**: Put users in control of their data at all times
3. **Limited data**: Collect what is needed, de-identify where possible, and delete when no longer necessary

## Opt-in behavior

Semgrep’s opt-in aggregate metrics are only sent when the environment variable `SEMGREP_SEND_METRICS` is set or when the flag `--enable-metrics` is set. If this environment variable is not set or if the flag is not set, the aggregate metrics are not sent anywhere.

Note that certain Semgrep integrators set this environment variable by default. For example, both the [Semgrep CI agent](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep-action) and [GitLab's Semgrep SAST analyzer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/semgrep) enable aggregate-metrics collection by default.

## Collected data

Semgrep collects non-identifiable data to improve the user experience. Four types of data are collected:

### Environmental

Environmental data provides contextual data about Semgrep’s runtime environment, as well as information that helps debug any issues users may be facing; e.g.

* How long the command took to run
* The version of Semgrep
* Pseudoanonymized hash of the scanned project’s name
* Pseudoanonymized hash of the rule definitions run
* Pseduoanonymized hash of the config option

### Performance

Performance data enables understanding of which rules and types of files are slow in the aggregate so r2c can improve the Semgrep program-analysis engine, query optimizer, and debug slow rules; e.g.

* Runtime duration
* Total number of rules
* Total number of files
* Project size in bytes

### Errors

High-level error and warning classes that Semgrep encounters when run; e.g.

* Semgrep’s return code
* The number of errors
* Compile-time error names, e.g., MaxFileSizeExceeded, SystemOutOfMemory, UnknownFileEncoding

### Value

Semgrep reports data that indicate how useful a run is for the end user; e.g.

* Number of raised findings
* Number of ignored findings
* Pseudoanonymized hashes of the rule definitions that yield findings

### Data NOT collected

We strive to balance our desire to collect data for improving Semgrep with our users' need for privacy. The following items don't leave your environment and are not sent or shared with anyone.

* Source code
* Raw repository names, filenames, file contents, or commit hashes
* User-identifiable data about Semgrep’s findings in your code, including finding messages
* Private rules

### Pseudoanonymization

Certain identifying data (e.g. project URLs) are pseudoanonymized before being sent to the r2c backend. "Pseudoanonymized" means the data are transformed using a deterministic cryptographically secure hash.

We use a deterministic hash to:
* Track performance and value improvements over succesive runs on projects
* Remove test data from our metrics

Using a deterministic hash, however, implies:
* An entity that independently knows the value of an input datum AND who has access to r2c's metrics data could access metrics for that known datum

r2c will:
* Protect these metrics data using application-security best practices
* Only correlate hashed data to input data when these inputs are publicly known (e.g. publicly available project URLs for open-source projects)
