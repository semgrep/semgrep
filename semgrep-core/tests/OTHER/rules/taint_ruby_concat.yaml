  message: "Detected string concatenation with a non-literal variable in a pg Ruby
    SQL statement. This could lead to SQL injection if the variable is
    user-controlled and not properly sanitized. In order to prevent SQL injection,
    used parameterized queries or prepared statements instead. You can use
    parameterized queries like so: `conn.exec_params('SELECT $1 AS a, $2 AS b, $3
    AS c', [1, 2, nil])` And you can use prepared statements with
    `exec_prepared`."
