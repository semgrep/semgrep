// The fix was os.WriteFile($F, $D, $P) but
// the range for $D was wrong because we were missing
// the closing ')' in the cast, or the closing '}' in the CompositeLit.
// This test does not really check that, but at least if you
// use -dump_ast -full_token_info on the .go you should now see
// that the closing paren or brace is in the generic AST
