# These are build dependencies.
# Development-only dependencies are in 'dev/dev.opam'.
# A big dependency is pfff, but it's now a submodule so it's not listed here
#TODO: restore  "bisect_ppx" {>= "2.5.0"} once can use ppxlib 0.22.0

# For semgrep CI to be fast, we try to pre-install these packages as part of
# of the base docker image. When you add a new package or change a version
# here, please also update the list of packages there:
#
#   https://github.com/returntocorp/ocaml-layer/blob/master/common-config.sh
#
# or ask Martin to do so.
# You may also need to update the ocaml:alpine-xxx image used in ../Dockerfile.
