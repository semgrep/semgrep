       * Note that we tried to solve this with a hack in returntocorp/semgrep#5150
       * but it caused a bunch of FPs in semgrep-rules. The hack was essentially
       * to assume that in `x.f(y)` taint always propagated from `y` to `x`.
       *
       * The typical FP was a call that incorrectly tainted an object or module,
       * that also happened to be part of a sink specification. For example, in
       * rule ruby.rails.security.audit.avoid-tainted-shell-call the `Shell` class
       * does not really get tainted even if we call `Shell.cat` on tainted data:
       *
       *     # ruleid: avoid-tainted-shell-call
       *     Shell.cat(params[:filename])
       *
       * But with the hack, `Shell` becomes tainted. Later on, when we call
       * `Shell.cat` on safe data, it triggered an FP. Why? Because the entire
       * `Shell.cat(...)` was marked as a sink, and `Shell` was considered
       * tainted!
       *
       *     # ok: avoid-tainted-shell-call
       *     Shell.cat("/var/log/www/access.log")
       *
       * Most of these FPs could be prevented by fine tuning pattern-sinks. But
       * anyhow it's clearly incorrect to taint `Shell`, so a better solution was
       * needed (hence `pattern-propagators`).
