(* Prelude *)
(*****************************************************************************)
(* The goal of this module is to resolve names, a.k.a naming or
 * scope resolution, and to do it in a generic way on the generic AST.
 * update: this module is also (ab)used to propagate type information
 * used in semgrep for matching typed metavariables.
 *
 * In a compiler you often have those phases:
 *  - lexing
 *  - parsing
 *  - naming (the goal of this file)
 *  - typing
 *  - intermediate code generation
 *  - optimizing
 *  - ...
 *
 * The goal of the naming phase is to simplify following phases by having
 * each use of an entity clearly linked to its definition. For example,
 * when you see in the AST the use of the identifier 'a', this 'a'
 * could reference a local variable, or a parameter, or a global,
 * or a global defined in another module but imported in the current
 * namespace, or a variable defined in a nested block that "shadows" an
 * enclosing variable with the same name.
 * By resolving once and for all all uses of an entity to its definition,
 * for example by renaming some shadow variables (see AST_generic.gensym),
 * we simpify further phases, which don't have to maintain anymore a
 * complex environment to deal with scoping issues
 * (see the essence Of Python paper "Python: The Full Monty" where they
 * show that even complex IDEs still do not correctly handle Python
 * scoping rules and perform wrong renaming refactorings).
 *
 * Resolving names by tagging identifiers is also useful for
 * codemap/efuns to colorize identifiers (locals, params, globals, unknowns)
 * differently.
 *
 * alternatives:
 *  - CURRENT: generic naming and use of a 'ref resolved_name' to annotate
 *    the generic AST. Note that the use of a ref that can be shared with
 *    the lang-specific AST (e.g., ast_go.ml) allows tools like codemap/efuns
 *    to benefit from the generic naming analysis while still caring only
 *    about the lang-specific AST (even though we may want at some point
 *    to have a generic highlighter).
 *  - define a separate type for a named ast, e.g., nast.ml (as done in
 *    hack/skip) instead of modifying refs, with a unique identifier
 *    for each entity. However, this is tedious to
 *    write as both types are almost identical (maybe a functor could help,
 *    or a generic aast type as in recent hack code). Moreover, this is really
 *    useful for complex global analysis (or at least semi-global as in
 *    OCaml where you still need to open many .cmi when you locally type a .ml)
 *    such as typing where we want to resolve every use of a global.
 *    For semgrep, where we might for quite some time restrict ourselves to
 *    local analysis, maybe the ref implementation technique is good enough.
 *  - implement a resolve_xxx.ml for each language instead of doing it
 *    on the generic AST. That is what I was doing previously, which
 *    has some advantages (some language-specific constructs that introduce
 *    new variables, for example Python comprehensions, are hard to analyze
 *    once converted to the generic AST because they are under an
 *    Other_xxx category)
 *    update: actually comprehensions are now a regular AST element
 *    However, there's potentially lots of code
 *    duplication for each language and it's easy for a language to fall
 *    behind.
 *    A nice compromise might be to do most of the work in naming_ast.ml
 *    but still have lang-specific resolve_xxx.ml to tag special
 *    constructs that override what naming_ast.ml would do.
 *    See set_resolved()
 *
 * TODO:
 *  - generalize the original "resolvers":
 *    * resolve_go.ml
 *    * resolve_python.ml
 *    * ast_js_build.ml
 *    * check_variables_cpp.ml
 *    * check_variables_php.ml
 *  - introduce extra VarDef for languages that do not have them like
 *    Python/PHP where the first use is a def (which in turn requires
 *    special construct like 'global' or 'nonlocal' to disable this).
 *  - go:
 *    * handle DShortVars and Foreach local vars, DMethod receiver parameter,
 *      and TypeName for new types
 *    * in theory if/for/switch with their init declare new scope, as well
 *      as Block
 *    * should do first pass to get all toplevel decl as you can use
 *      forward ref in Go
 *  - get rid of the original "resolvers":
 *    * resolve_xxx.ml
 *    * ast_js_build.ml
 *    * check_variables_xxx.ml
 *  - get rid of or unify scope_code.ml, scope_php.ml, and
 *    ast_generic.resolved_name
 *  - resolve also types! in java if you import org.foo.Bar then later
 *    you can simply use Bar x; for a type, but we don't currently resolve
 *    those.
 *
 * history:
 *  - PHP deadcode detector with global analysis and global code database
 *  - local name resolution for PHP and C/C++ in check_variables_cpp.ml and
 *    check_variables_php.ml for codemap semantic highlighting of identifiers
 *    (mainly local vs params vs globals vs unknown) and for checkModule
 *    (scheck ancestor). Use of a ref for C/C++.
 *  - graph_code_xxx.ml global name resolution for PHP, then Java,
 *    then ML, then ML via cmt, then Clang ASTs, then C, then Javascript
 *  - separate named AST (nast.ml) and naming phase for Hack
 *  - local name resolution for code highlighting for Javascript, then Python
 *    to better colorize identifiers in codemap/efuns, but separate from
 *    a variable checker (resolve_xxx.ml instead of check_variables_xxx.ml)
 *  - AST generic and its resolved_name ref
 *  - simple resolve_python.ml with variable and import resolution
 *  - separate resolve_go.ml with import resolution
 *  - try to unify those resolvers in one file, naming_ast.ml
 *  - resolve names for OCaml constructs and factorize name resolution
 *    in better 'name' type and 'kname' hook.
