 * For example, range provided by the user is (0, 29). First call to any_at_range
 * returns found (0, 17). The found match is added to the list and then
 * any_at_range is called again with (18, 29). If another match is found
 * then it is appended to the list.

 * Empty list is returned if no matches are found.
