  This is invoked by bridge_ml.c and accepts a function pointer wrapped
  as an OCaml value:

  * read_file_fnptr: Map a file name to either:
      - (file contents, 0), if successful, or
      - (UTF-8 error message, error code), if not.

  The numeric error codes are defined by the BridgeErrorCode enum
  defined in bridge_ml.h.  This code raises corresponding exceptions.

  The interface is very similar to that of 'semgrep_analyze' in the
  Python 'semgrep_bridge_python' module, which is defined and documented
  in bridge_py.c.

  The Fnptr.t objects are only valid for the duration of this call.
