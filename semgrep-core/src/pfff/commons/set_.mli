(** Sets over ordered types.

    This module implements the set data structure, given a total ordering
    function over the set elements. All operations over sets
    are purely applicative (no side-effects).
    The implementation uses balanced binary trees, and is therefore
    reasonably efficient: insertion and membership take time
    logarithmic in the size of the set, for instance.

      (** A total ordering function over the set elements.
          This is a two-argument function [f] such that
          [f e1 e2] is zero if the elements [e1] and [e2] are equal,
          [f e1 e2] is strictly negative if [e1] is smaller than [e2],
          and [f e1 e2] is strictly positive if [e1] is greater than [e2].

          comparison function {!Pervasives.compare}. *)

    that satisfy predicate [p]. *)

(** [partition p s] returns a pair of sets [(s1, s2)], where

    [Not_found] if the set is empty. *)

val max_elt: 'elt t -> 'elt
(** Same as {!Set.S.min_elt}, but returns the largest element of the
    given set. *)

val choose: 'elt t -> 'elt
(** Return one element of the given set, or raise [Not_found] if
    the set is empty. Which element is chosen is unspecified,
    but equal elements will be chosen for equal sets. *)

val split: 'elt -> 'elt t -> 'elt t * bool * 'elt t
(** [split x s] returns a triple [(l, present, r)], where
      [l] is the set of elements of [s] that are
