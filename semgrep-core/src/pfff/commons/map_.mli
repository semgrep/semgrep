(** Association tables over ordered types.

    This module implements applicative association tables, also known as
    finite maps or dictionaries, given a total ordering function
    over the keys.
    All operations over maps are purely applicative (no side-effects).
    The implementation uses balanced binary trees, and therefore searching
    and insertion take time logarithmic in the size of the map.

          This is a two-argument function [f] such that

          comparison function {!Pervasives.compare}. *)
