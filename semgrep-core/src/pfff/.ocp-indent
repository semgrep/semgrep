# Indent for clauses inside a pattern-match (after the arrow):
#    match foo with
#    | _ ->
#    ^^^^bar
# the default is 2, which aligns the pattern and the expression
match_clause = 4

# When nesting expressions on the same line, their indentation are in
# some cases stacked, so that it remains correct if you close them one
# at a line. This may lead to large indents in complex code though, so
# this parameter can be used to set a maximum value. Note that it only
# affects indentation after function arrows and opening parens at end
# of line.
#
# for example (left: `none`; right: `4`)
#    let f = g (h (i (fun x ->     #    let f = g (h (i (fun x ->
#          x)                      #        x)
#        )                         #      )
#      )                           #    )
max_indent = 2
