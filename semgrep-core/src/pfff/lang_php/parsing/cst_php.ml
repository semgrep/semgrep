(* Concrete Syntax Tree (CST) for PHP.
 *
 * Currently, the CST supports mostly PHP 5.2 with
 * a few extensions from PHP 5.3 (e.g. closures, namespace, const) and
 * PHP 5.4 (e.g. traits) as well as support for many Facebook
 * extensions (XHP, generators, annotations, generics, collections,
 * type definitions, implicit fields via constructor parameters).
 *
 * Update: I removed many facebook extensions to simplify (e.g., XHP).
 * Moreover, this CST is mostly used for semgrep now, so we may
 * gradually transform it into ast_php.ml to avoid an extra intermediate
 * when converting from PHP to the generic AST.
 * For example, use Foo\Bar\{A, B} is not represented faithfully anymore
 * in this CST, and it's unsugared in use Foo\Bar\A and use Foo\Bar\B
 * (like in ast_php.ml).
 * The main requirement for this hybrid CST/AST
 * is to get the range of an expr/stmt/... correct so you must keep
 * the first and last token of an expr/stmt/... in the AST.
 *
 *
 * A CST is convenient in a refactoring context or code visualization
 * context, but if you need to do some heavy static analysis, consider
 * instead lang_php/analyze/foundation/pil.ml which defines a
 * PHP Intermediate Language a la CIL.
 *
 * todo:
 *  - unify toplevel statement vs statements? hmmm maybe not
 *  - maybe even in a refactoring context a PIL+comment
 *    (see pretty/ast_pp.ml) would make more sense.
 *
 * NOTE: data from this type are often marshalled in berkeley DB tables
 * which means that if you add a new constructor or field in the types below,
 * you must erase the berkeley DB databases otherwise pfff
 * will probably ends with a segfault (OCaml serialization is not
 * type-safe). A hacky solution is to add new constructors only at the end
 * of a type definition.
 *
 * COUPLING: some programs in other languages (e.g. Python) may
 * use some of the pfff binding, or json/sexp exporters, so if you
 * change the name of constructors in this file, don't forget
 * to regenerate the json/sexp exporters, but also to modify the
 * dependent programs !!!! An easier solution is to not change this
 * file, or to only add new constructors.
