Many of the code in this directory comes from ocamlnet/netstring/.
I've modified this code to remove the many dependencies to ocamlnet/, split
nethtml.ml into a separate ast_html.ml and parse_html.ml and added
some token information in the HTML tree so one can give precise
error message with file location and one can also do a html highlighter
for codemap.
