Lots of small modifications:
 - fix warnings with recent OCaml (unused vars, unused rec)
 - update to latest dypgen (will_shift <- false => @{..., [DontShift],
   [x] -> <x>)
 - fixed ambiguity with ternary expression, change ternary priorities (was
   generating lots of "parsing errors" even on old ruby code)
 - split files in helpers, have smaller grammar and ast files
 - rename files to add _ruby suffix
 - rename constructors in ast_ruby.ml (was ast.ml), remove E_ prefix,
   String_, Lit_
 - get rid of dependencies to config.ml, build_vars.ml, etc.
 - add a dumper using ocaml.ml and ocamltarzan
