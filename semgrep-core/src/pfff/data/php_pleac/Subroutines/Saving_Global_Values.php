// Please refer to discussion about PHP scope in section two of this chapter.
// Briefly, PHP assumes a variable name within a function to be local unless
// it has been specifically declared with the, 'global', keyword, in which
// case it refers to a variable in the 'superglobal' array, '$GLOBALS'. Thus,
// inadvertant variable name shadowing cannot occur since it is it not possible
// to use the same name to refer to both a local and a global variable. If
// accessing a global variable care should be taken to not accidentally update
// it. The techniques used in this section are simply not required.
