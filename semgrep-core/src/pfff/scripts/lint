It looks like the user who committed the code did not set up their
pre-commit hook. You need the following one-time setup:

  1. Install the 'pre-commit' command:

       $ pip3 install pre-commit

  2. Install the pre-commit hooks for the repo:

       $ pre-commit install

  3. Install ocp-indent:

       $ opam install ocp-indent

  4. To fix already committed code, run:

       $ pre-commit run --all
EOF
  exit 1
fi
