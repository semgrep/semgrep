# Everything, including a literal, is an object, so this works:
-199.abs                                                 # => 199
'ice is nice'.length                                     # => 11
'ruby is cool.'.index('u')                               # => 1
"Nice Day Isn't It?".downcase.split('').uniq.sort.join
# => " '?acdeinsty"
