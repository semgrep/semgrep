To install Pfff under Windows, you must first install Cygwin (see https://www.cygwin.com/).

Then, install a few Cygwin packages:
 - autoconf (needed to install from source many opam packages)
 - automake
 - opam

Once OPAM is installed, you will need to install a compatible
version of OCaml and a few OPAM packages:
 - opam init
 - opam switch 4.07.0
 - opam install dune json-wheel


Troubles?
------------
- If 'opam init' seems to never finish, still wait and later on, even
  if the command does not terminate, you should get a valid ~/.opam/
  directory.
