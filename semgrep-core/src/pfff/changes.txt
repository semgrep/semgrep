* 0.39 (Q4 2019) (real Python parser, a generic AST, a generic sgrep/scheck)
10 years of Pfff! Started in November 2009 (while at Facebook).

** big split! move sgrep/spatch, codemap, codegraph, the lang_xxx bytecode
related, mini, and scheck in separate repositories
either under github.com/returntocorp (pfff, sgrep, check_generic)
or under github.com/aryx

a generic AST helping to factorize AST/visitor-based analysis,
but now also CFG/DFG-based analysis, across multiple languages.

** introducing lang_skip/
basic lexer and highlighter.

** introducing lang_GENERIC/
to factorize analysis on generic AST (e.g., control flow graph).

C, and Java.

*** resolve names in sgrep, so can look for original function
and sgrep will find aliases.
Support for Python only for now (Javascript should be similar).

*** basic handling of '...' between statements!
the PHP version of sgrep never had that!
(coccinelle had though, and even better with working on the CFG).

e.g., unreachable statement detection using a generic control flow graph.

* 0.38 (Q3 2019) (a real AST for Javascript)

using toy datalog (written in Lua)

*** switch to bddbddb for backend, scales to xv6 and even plan9 kernel!
7000 and 100000 LOC respectively

** introduce codeslicer
it tries to detect automatically less relevant
code, that is the yet-another-extension-plugins that are not important
to understand the software architecture (e.g. for Linux it would

* 0.27 (Q1 2014) ("hypertext" codemap, generalized scheck)

** codemap

*** match defs and uses even when the file has been modified
(do not use the probably obsolete line information in graph_code, trust
more the lexer/parser/highlighter fuzzy def/use classifier)

*** show uses/defs relations also at use site
so can hover on some code and see the corresponding definition
(as well as the other users of this definition and the uses of
this definition).

*** show uses/defs macrolevel dependencies for directories
scalable spirit! a visualization should apply from the topmost
entities to the lowest one! Also factorized more code.

*** show information about entity under cursor (def or use) in tooltip

*** go to definition when on a use
finally ... basic TAGS functionality, "hypertext" because can follow "links"

*** handle skip list
so easy to manually configure which parts to not display when
the heuristics in archi_code_lexer are not enough.

*** improve completion box by considering not only files mentions in the
light db (while still filtering object files and skip list files)

a package/module dependency visualizer exporting data for Gephi
(only for ocaml code for now). Played with it on the code of pfff
(in package mode) and some of its components: codemap, cpp, php, cmf

* -----------------------------------------------------------

* 0.14 (Q4 2010) (layers, spatch php, more language highlighters)

** codemap

*** layer type, so can save results of global analysis and process them
later in codemap or pfff_statistics

*** layers! like in google earth

- architecture/aspect layer (default one)
- static dead code layer
- dead: dynamic live code layer (using xhprof data)
- test coverage layer (using phpunit and xdebug data)
-
- bugs layer
- security layer
- cyclomatic complexity,
- age (and activity) layer
- number of authors layer

*** more semantic visual feedback
can see arguments passed by refs visually (TakeArgNByRef)
as well as functions containing dynamic calls (ContainDynamicCall)

*** visual grep
can now visualize the result of a git grep on a project

*** better visualization of directories
use different color for dirs and files labels, and highlight first
letter of label at depth = 1


** introduce spatch, a syntactical patch
a DSL to express easily refactoring on PHP.

** sgrep/spatch

*** better support for XHP patterns with flexible matching
on attributes

*** experimental support for statement patterns
   can now express patterns like:
    sgrep -e 'foreach($A as $V) { if (strpos($T, $V) !== false) { return Z; }}'

so can visualize also Tex/Latex/Noweb source (which includes
the documentation of pfff!)

** introducing lang_java/
based on joust

** introducing lang_lisp/

** introducing lang_haskell/

** introducing lang_python/
just a lexer-based highlighter. No real parser yet.

update: superseded by ast_php_simple.ml

*** dead? dataflow analysis using PIL (thanks to iproctor)
update: supersed by abstract interpreter

** global analysis

*** store additional attributes/properties per entities in the light code db
- does it take argument by refs.
- does it contain dynamic calls ($fn(...))

This can help the visualizer to give more semantic visual feedback.

** documentation
wrote wiki pages (intro, sgrep, spatch, features, vision, roadmap, etc)

applied codemap on many open source project and generated screenshots.

** internals

*** refactored the code in visual/ to have smaller and cleaner files
thanks to literate programming and codemap itself to show the problem
and assist in the refactoring

*** refactored code about defs/uses in defs_uses_php.ml
and put more generic stuff in h_program-lang/

*** renamed pfff_visual in codemap

** commons/graph.ml
a polymorphic wrapper around ocamlgraph

(to compute strongly connected components of php callgraph, in prevision
of a bottom up analysis of php)

update: also useful for codegraph backend.

* 0.13

first public release!
https://github.com/facebook/pfff

* 0.12 (Q3 2010) (codemap, light db, tags php, scheck php, ocaml/js parsers)

Real start of multi-language support.

** introduce source code  navigator/searcher/visualizer using cairo

Show treemap and thumbnails of file content!
Have also minimap, zoom, labels, alpha for overlapping labels,
labels in diagonal, anamorphic content showing in bigger fonts
the important stuff, magnifying glass, clickable content
where a click opens the file in your editor at the right place, etc.
=> A kind of google maps but on code :)

Support for PHP, Javascript, ML, C++, C, thrift.

For PHP do also URL highlighting which helps understand the control flow
in webapps.
Also highlight local/globals/parameters variables differently.
Also highlight bad smells (especially security related bad smells)

Integrate other PL artifacts:
 - The builtins API reference
 - PLEAC cookbooks
=> a single place to query information about the code
(no need to first grep the code, then google for the function
 because it turns out to be a builtin).

Can easily go the definition of a function (whether it's a builtin or not,
thanks to the parsable PHP manual and HPHP idl files).

Can easily go to the example of use of a function (whether it's a builtin
or not, thanks to PLEAC for the builtin functions).

Far more flexible and powerful than the previous treemap visualizer
which was using Graphics. Now also render file content!

** new tool, stags, a TAG generator using ASTs not fragle regexp
support for PHP ocaml

** introduce lang_ml/
Allow to use and experiment the treemap code visualizer on the pfff
source itself; to see if such features are useful.

** introduce lang_cpp/

and a -pvar option to print matched metavarables instead of matched code

** internals
reorganized the treemap and h_program-lang/ to be less
facebook and pfff specific. Have a commons/file_type.ml for instance.
