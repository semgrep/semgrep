To install pfff under macOS, you must first install Brew (see http://brew.sh)
or MacPorts (see http://www.macports.org/).

Then, install a few packages, for example with Brew:
 $ brew install objective-caml

For codequery:
 $ brew install swi-prolog

=> you can now run './configure' and build the many pfff tools :)
See install.txt for the remaining steps.
