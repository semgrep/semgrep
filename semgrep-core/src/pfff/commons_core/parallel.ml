 * Some simple helpers around harrop's invoke() to do some
 * map-reduce like parallel programming using fork.
 *
 * related work:
 *  - https://gitorious.org/parmap, very similar, but also contains
 *    a master/workers model which helps do some form of load balancing
 *
 *  - https://github.com/MyLifeLabs/nproc, but it uses lwt
 *
 *  - distribution.ml which use MPI and so can leverage multiple
 *    machines (but MPI turned out to be quite unstable in my experience)
 *
 *  - julien's MultiWorker but works only in native code
 *
 * less: could be useful to autodetect a good number based on the
 * number of cores and available memory like we do in our libphutil 'Future'
 * library.

                The documentation in marshal.mli is pretty clear:

                Values of extensible variant types, for example exceptions (of
                extensible type [exn]), returned by the unmarshaller should not be
                pattern-matched over through [match ... with] or [try ... with],
                because unmarshalling does not preserve the information required for
                matching their constructors. Structural equalities with other
                extensible variant values does not work either.  Most other uses such
                as Printexc.to_string, will still work as expected.

               * exception. You can just print it or do ugly Obj.magic
               * level stuff with it.
