To install pfff, you must first install recent versions of:
 - OCaml (at least 4.07.0)
   see http://caml.inria.fr/download.en.html
 - opam - http://opam.ocaml.org
 - dune - `opam install dune`, https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/dune/
 - SWI-prolog
   if you want the interactive code query tool
 - Java (for bddbddb)
   if you want the datalog pointer analysis

If you want most of the good things just type:

  $ ./configure
  $ opam install . --deps-only
  $ make

This should generate a few binaries in `_build/install/default/bin/` such
as `pfff`.  To install binaries and libraries, run `make install`.
