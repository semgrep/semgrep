[ANN] pfff_visual, a fancy code visualizer/navigator for OCaml, and more

Hi list,

It is my pleasure to announce pfff_visual, a code visualizer/navigator
for OCaml. Note that this is not a replacement for Emacs, but more a
companion that works with Emacs.

A demo is available here:
 part1: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRZjBGD3osw
 part2: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=993pmNLY_VU

pfff_visual is using pfff, which is mainly an OCaml API to write
static analysis, dynamic analysis, code visualizations, code
navigations, or style-preserving source-to-source transformations such
as refactorings on source code. For now the effort is focused on PHP
but there is preliminary support for Javascript, and C++ code.
There is also preliminary support for OCaml code so that the infrastructure
can be used on the code of pfff itself.

You can get the source of pfff and pfff_visual here:
 http://github.com/facebook/pfff

Here is how to install it:
 $ git clone git@github.com:facebook/pfff.git
 $ ./configure
 $ make depend; make; make opt
 $ ./pfff_visual /path/to/project/using/supported/languages

pfff has been tested on MacOS and Linux and is licensed under the LGPL.
