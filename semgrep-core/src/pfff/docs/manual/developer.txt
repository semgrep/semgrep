What to do when a segfault ?

See ast_php.ml:
 * NOTE: data from this type are often marshalled in berkeley DB tables
 * which means that if you add new constructor or field in the types below,
 * you must erase the berkeley DB databases otherwise pfff
 * will probably finish with a segfault (OCaml serialization is not
 * type-safe).
