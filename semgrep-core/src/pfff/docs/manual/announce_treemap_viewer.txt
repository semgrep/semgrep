I've made a simple treemap viewer command line program called treemap_viewer.
It takes a JSON file describing a tree of dirs and files with size attributes
and colors and renders it using one of the treemap algorithm. See ex.json
for an example of input. In the futur I could generate a PNG or
gif map so one can click on it (like graphviz)

Test Plan:
ssh -Y on a linux machine and do
$ /home/pad/c-pfff/h_visualization/treemap_viewer  /home/pad/c-pfff/h_visualization/examples/treemap/ex.json
this should display a treemap  X11 window.

You can test on a bigger treemap:
$ /home/pad/c-pfff/h_visualization/treemap_viewer  /home/pad/c-pfff/facebook/data/flib_treemap.json

If you want to build it yourself, do
$ git clone /home/engshare/git/projects/pfff
$ cd pfff/
$ source env.sh
$ ./configure -facebook -bdb
$ make depend; make
