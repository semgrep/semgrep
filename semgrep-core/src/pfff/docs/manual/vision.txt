Analyze php/javascript/css/sql as well as their interactions, holistically.
Analyze ocaml code so can apply the ideas to my own code :)
Analyze deeply, lexing, parsing, typing, linking, and flowing!
(even though there is dimininushing return at each step for the developer)

Analyze statically and dynamically.
Mine all code artifacts: code, git, org, mailing lists, documentation
 for useful specifications, coupling, etc.

Visualize/Search/Navigate/Analyze.

Big TODOs:
 - dataflow
 - interprocedural analysis
 - context sensitive analysis
 - type inference

inspiration:
 - OCaml environment. Good library, good tools.
 - DrScheme. Make it easy to learn the language and excellent API
   documentation.
 - Perl. Good documentation, with examples of use for each func.
