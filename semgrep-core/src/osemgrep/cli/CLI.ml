   Library defining the semgrep command-line interface.

   This module determines the subcommand invoked on the command line
   and has another module handle it as if it were an independent command.
   We don't use Cmdliner to dispatch subcommands because it's a too
   complicated and we never show a help page for the whole command anyway
   since we fall back to the 'scan' subcommand if none is given.

   Translated from cli.py

  To get started quickly, run `semgrep scan --config auto`

  Run `semgrep SUBCOMMAND --help` for more information on each subcommand

  If no subcommand is passed, will run `scan` subcommand by default

Options:
  -h, --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  ci            The recommended way to run semgrep in CI
  login         Obtain and save credentials for semgrep.dev
  logout        Remove locally stored credentials to semgrep.dev
  lsp           [EXPERIMENTAL] Start the Semgrep LSP server
  publish       Upload rule to semgrep.dev
  scan          Run semgrep rules on files
  shouldafound  Report a false negative in this project.
