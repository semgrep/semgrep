(*
   Handles all file include/exclude logic for semgrep

   Assumes file system does not change during it's existence to cache
   files for a given language etc. If file system changes (i.e. git checkout),
   create a new TargetManager object

   If respect_git_ignore is true then will only consider files that are
   tracked or (untracked but not ignored) by git

   If git_baseline_commit is true then will only consider files that have
   changed since that commit

   If allow_unknown_extensions is set then targets with extensions that are
   not understood by semgrep will always be returned by get_files. Else will discard
   targets with unknown extensions

   TargetManager not to be confused with https://jobs.target.com/search-jobs/store%20manager
