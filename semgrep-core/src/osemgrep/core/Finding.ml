   A semgrep finding.

   A unique key designed with data-completeness & correctness in mind.

   Results in more unique findings than ci_unique_key.

   Used for deduplication in the CLI before writing output.

   A unique key designed with notification user experience in mind.

   Results in fewer unique findings than cli_unique_key.

(*
   Used to sort findings in output.

   Note that we often batch by rule ID when gathering matches,
   so the included self.rule_id will not do anything in those cases.

   The message field is included to ensure a consistent ordering
   when two findings match with different metavariables on the same code.

(*
   A unique key with match based id's notion of uniqueness in mind.

   We use this to check if two different findings will have the same match
   based id or not. This is so we can then index them accordingly so two
   similar findings will have unique match based IDs
*)

(*
    A section of code that matches a single rule (which is potentially many
    patterns).

    This is also often referred to as a finding.

     Do not use this extra field! This prevents from having typed JSON output

      dependency_match_only: Optional[bool] = field(default=None)
      dependency_matches: Optional[Any] = field(default=None)
     but then this would require to remove the @frozen from this class
     because autofix and dependency_aware and join_rule are actually monkey patching
     this frozen class.
     TODO: redundant with core.extra but we do some monkey patching on
     this extra field which prevents to use directly core.extra (immutable)
