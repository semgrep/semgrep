(******************************************************************************
 * Full result information
 *
 * In addition to the results (matches + errors), we also may report extra
 * information, such as the skipped targets or the profiling times. Many
 * of the types here are created to collect profiling information in as
 * well-typed a manner as possible. Creating a type for practically every
 * stage that reports matches is annoying, but prevents us from relying on
 * dummy values or unlabeled tuples.
 *
 * Another challenge we face is that the extra information can take a lot
 * of memory, which scales with both the number of rules and files. On
 * large repos, this is the most significant factor driving semgrep's
 * memory consumption. Therefore, if the skipped targets (for example) are
 * not being used, we don't want to save them. On the other hand, we want
 * to feel confident in the correctness of the code and make it easy to
 * know what is or isn't being saved. And we want our code to be relatively
 * readable.
 *
 * The debug_info type attempts to solve this. It has a variant for each
 * verbosity mode semgrep-core may be invoked with, which contains all
 * the fields semgrep requests from semgrep-core in that mode. Each result
 * contains debug_info in addition to the always-reported fields. The
 * variant of debug_info used in the results is always determined either
 * by the mode, which is a global set in Main.ml after the arguments are
 * read, or by a previous result. In this way we ensure that the fields
 * stored in the result are determined by the arguments passed by the user.
 *
 * Alternatives considered to the extra field:
 * - storing the information but just ommitting it in the final result (I
 *   tried this but it still uses too much memory)
 * - using option types within the result types for field and a global
 *   config to decide which fields are in use
 *
 * I considered the latter, but I'm not a fan of mix-and-match option types.
 * Maybe I just think it makes it tempting to use map_option, where here
 * the assumption that is being made feels more obvious. It also makes it
 * extra clear what information is being used for each mode and encourages
 * us to do the work of deciding what should be included instead of giving
 * the user choice that they probably don't know how to make intelligently.
 * That being said, if we wanted users to be able to "mix-and-match" request
 * fields, we should move to the option-types paradigm. Also, the collate
 * functions are quite ugly. I'm open to argument.
 *
 * TODO: We could use atdgen to specify those to factorize type definitions
 * that have to be present anyway in Output_from_core.atd.
