   Trickery to offer two collections of equality functions:

   - structural equality: do two AST nodes have the same structure?
     This diregards IDs assigned uniquely to AST nodes.
   - referential equality: are these two AST nodes physically the same?
     This is essentially physical equality but it tolerates copying or even
     some transformation as long as the node ID is preserved.

   Comparing two AST nodes must be done via one of the with_equal_* wrappers
   so as to select structural or referential equality.
