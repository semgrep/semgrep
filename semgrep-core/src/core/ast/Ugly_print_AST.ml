(* UglyPrinter prints syntactically-correct code without attempting to format it
 * nicely (as opposed to a pretty printer such as those based on Wadler's "A
 * prettier printer" [1]). It would be difficult, if not impossible, to print
 * code that conforms to everyone's style guides, linters, and formatters, so
 * the prettifying of code is left to other tools.
 *
 * UglyPrinter can print code snippets, not just full programs. Any of the
 * `print_` methods can be used by consumers.
 *
 * If UglyPrinter encounters a construct that it is unable to handle, it returns
 * `Error`. It is crucial that maintainers preserve this property, since
 * otherwise it is possible that we could present syntactically-incorrect code
 * as part of, for example, an autofix.
 *
 * Classes are used here so that we can take advantage of inheritance for
 * implementation-sharing and dynamic dispatch. Dynamic dispatch allows for the
 * hybrid printer used for autofix, where we use the original text from the
 * target or pattern for nodes that have been lifted unchanged. This is
 * implemented by inheriting from the plain printer. With a different
 * architecture, printer authors would need to deal with the logic for this.
 * This way, printer authors need only focus on printing AST correctly.
 *
 * OCaml's powerful object system will also allow us to share implementation
 * between printers to whatever extent is appropriate. `Pretty_print_AST`, for
 * example, gates on language within each function. We could replicate that here
 * if we like.
 *
 * This module should replace `Pretty_print_AST`. The main motivator for
 * creating a new printer module is that the use of classes allows for the
 * hybrid printer in autofix, as described above. `Pretty_print_AST` also does
 * not consistently report when it is unable to print a node correctly. We can
 * address that as we migrate it here.
