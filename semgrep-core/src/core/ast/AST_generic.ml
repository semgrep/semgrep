(* Prelude *)
(*****************************************************************************)
(* A generic AST, to factorize similar "analysis" in different programming
 * languages (e.g., naming, semantic code highlighting, semgrep!).
 *
 * Right now this generic AST is mostly the factorized union of:
 *  - Python, Ruby, Lua
 *  - Javascript, Typescript
 *  - PHP, Hack
 *  - Java, CSharp, Kotlin
 *  - C, C++
 *  - Go
 *  - JSON, YAML, HCL
 *  - OCaml, Scala, Rust
 *  - Bash, Docker
 *  - TODO SQL
 *
 * See Lang.ml for the list of supported languages.
 * See IL.ml for a generic IL (Intermediate language) better suited for
 * advanced static analysis (e.g., dataflow).
 *
 * rational: In the end, programming languages have a lot in Common.
 * Even though some interesting analysis are probably better done on a
 * per-language basis, many analysis are simple and require just an
 * AST and a visitor. One could duplicate those analysis for each language
 * or design an AST (this file) generic enough to factorize all those
 * analysis (e.g., unused entity). Note that we want to remain
 * as precise as possible and not lose too much information while going
 * from the specific language AST to the generic AST. We don't want
 * to be too generic as in ast_fuzzy.ml, where we have a very general
 * tree of nodes, but all the structure of the original AST is lost.
 *
 * The generic AST tries to be as close as possible to the original code but
 * not too close. When a programming language feature is really sugar or
 * an alternative way to do a thing, we usually unsugar. Here are the
 * simplifications done:
 *  - we do not keep the comma tokens in arguments. More generally we
 *    just keep the tokens to get the range right (see the discussions on
 *    invariants below) and get rid of the other (e.g., we remove
 *    parens around conditions in if). We keep the parens for 'Call'
 *    because we want to get the right range for those so we need the
 *    rightmost tokens in the AST.
 *  - multiple var declarations in one declaration (e.g., int a,b; in C)
 *    are expanded in multiple 'variable_definition'. Note that
 *    tuple assignments (e.g., a,b=1,2) are not expanded in multiple assigns
 *    because this is not always possible (e.g., a,b=foo()) and people may
 *    want to explicitely match tuples assignments (we do some magic in
 *    Generic_vs_generic though to let 'a=1' matches also 'a,b=1,2').
 *  - multiple entity imports in one declaration (e.g., from foo import {a,b})
 *    are expanded in multiple individual imports
 *    (in the example, from foo import a; from foo import b).
 *  - multiple ways to define a function are converted all to a
 *    'function_definition' (e.g., Javascript arrows are converted in that)
 *    update: but we now have a more precise function_body type
 *  - we are more general and impose less restrictions on where certain
 *    constructs can appear to simplify things.
 *     * there is no special lhs/lvalue type (see IL.ml for that) and so
 *      'Assign' takes a general 'expr' on its lhs.
 *     * there is no special toplevel/item vs stmt. Certain programming
 *       languages impose restrictions on where a function or directive can
 *       appear (e.g., just at the toplevel), but we allow those constructs
 *       at the stmt level.
 *     * the Splat and HashSplat operator can usually appear just in arguments
 *       or inside arrays or in struct definitions (a field) but we are more
 *       general and put it at the 'expr' level.
 *     * certain attributes are valid only for certain constructs but instead
 *       we use one attribute type (no class_attribute vs func_attribute etc.)
 *
 * Note that this generic AST has become gradually more and more a
 * generic CST, to fix issues in autofix in Semgrep.
 * TODO? it may be time to rename this file CST_generic.ml
 *
 * todo:
 *  - improve things for Kotlin/Scala/Rust/C++/Java
 *  - see ast_fuzzy.ml todos for ideas to use AST_generic for sgrep?
 *
 * related work:
 *  - ast_fuzzy.ml (in pfff)
 *  - github semantic (seems dead)
 *    https://github.com/github/semantic
 *  - UAST of babelfish
 *    https://doc.bblf.sh/uast/uast-specification-v2.html
 *  - Coverity common program representation?
 *  - Semmle internal common representation?
 *  - Sonarcube generic language
 *    https://github.com/SonarSource/slang
 *  - Facebook Infer SIL (for C++, Java, Objective-C)
 *  - Dawson Engler and Fraser Brown micro-checkers for multiple languages
 *  - Comby common representation by Rijnard,
 *    see "Lightweight Multi-language syntax transformation", but it does not
 *    really operate on an AST
 *  - https://tabnine.com/ which supports multiple languages, but probably
 *    again does not operate on an AST
 *  - srcML https://www.srcml.org/doc/srcMLGrammar.html
 *    but just for C/C++/C#/Java and seems pretty heavy
 *
 * design choices to have a generic data structure:
 *  - add some 'a, 'b, 'c around expr/stmt/...
 *  - data-type a la carte like in github-semantic but IMHO too high-level
 *    with astronaut-style architecture (too abstract, too advanced features).
 *  - CURRENT SOLUTION: the OtherXxx strategy used in this file (simple)
 *    update: actually switch to OtherXxx of todo_kind, even simpler
 *  - functorize and add some type hole (type tstmt; type texpr; ...),
 *    todo? not a bad idea if later we want to add type information on each
 *    expression nodes
 *
 * history:
 *  - started with crossproduct of Javascript, Python, PHP, Java, and C
 *    (and a bit of OCaml) after wanting to port checked_return from Js to
 *    Python and got the idea to factorize things
 *
 * INVARIANTS:
 *  - all the other_xxx types should contain only simple constructors (enums)
 *    without any parameter. I rely on that to simplify the code
 *    of the generic mapper and matcher.
 *    update: prefer todo_kind to those other_xxx types now.
 *    Same for keyword_attributes.
 *  - each expression or statement must have at least one token in it
 *    so that semgrep can track a location (e.g., 'Return of expr option'
 *    is not enough because with no expr, there is no location information
 *    for this return, so it must be 'Return of tok * expr option' instead)
 *  - each expression or statement should ideally have enough tokens in it
 *    to get its range, so at least the leftmost and rightmost token in
 *    all constructs, so the Return above should even be
 *    'Return of tok * expr option * tok' for the ending semicolon
 *    (alt: have the range info in each expr/stmt/pattern but big refactoring)
 *  - to correctly compute a CFG (Control Flow Graph), the stmt type
 *    should list all constructs that contains other statements and
 *    try to avoid to use the very generic 'OtherXxx of any'
 *  - to correctly compute a DFG (Data Flow Graph), and to correctly resolve
 *    names (see Naming_AST.ml), each constructs that introduce a new
 *    variable should have a relevant comment 'newvar:'
 *  - to correctly resolve names, each construct that introduces a new scope
 *    should have a relevant comment 'newscope:'
 *  - todo? each language should add the VarDefs that defines the locals
 *    used in a function (instead of having the first Assign play the role
 *    of a VarDef, as done in Python for example).
