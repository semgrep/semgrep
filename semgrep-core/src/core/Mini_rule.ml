(*****************************************************************************)
(* The goal of this module is to make it easy to add lint rules by using
 * semgrep patterns. You just have to store the patterns in a special
 * YAML file and add the corresponding warnings you want the linter to raise.
 *
 * update: if you need advanced patterns with boolean logic (which used
 * to be partially provided by the hacky OK error keyword), use
 * instead Rule.ml (or the semgrep python wrapper). Rule.ml also uses a YAML
 * file but it has more features, e.g. some pattern-either fields,
 * pattern-inside, metavariable-comparison, etc.

  (* at least one element *)
  (* Useful for debugging, to report bad rules. We could rule.id to
   * report those bad rules, but semgrep-python uses a weird encoding
   * when flattening the pattern-xxx (-and, -either, -not, etc.)
   * patterns in the original rule yaml file, which makes it hard
   * to know what what was the corresponding pattern.
