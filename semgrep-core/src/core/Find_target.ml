   The 7% threshold works well for javascript files based on looking at
   .min.js files and other .js found in various github repos.

   - very few minified files have more than 5% of whitespace. Those with more
     than 5% contain embedded data strings e.g.
     "1C10 LX0 1C10 LX0 1C10 Mn0 MN0 2jz0 ...".
   - no legitimate source files have less than 8% of whitespace and are larger
     than 500 bytes at the same time.
   - only some really short source files (2-3 lines) were found to have
     between 5% and 8% whitespace.

   This is for the few minified files that embed a bunch of space-separated

   0.001 is an average of 1000 bytes per line, which doesn't occur with

   files that are mostly comments made of very long lines.
