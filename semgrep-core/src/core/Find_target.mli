   Find target files suitable to be analyzed by semgrep, assuming a given
   language.

(*
   A target file marked as Filterable can be skipped if they
   don't have the right extension or if they don't look like a proper
   source file (not human-readable, wrong format, etc.).
   A target file marked as Explicit may not be skipped. Those are normally
   files requested directly by the user on the semgrep command line.

   This property is ignored if the target is a folder. Files discovered
   in a folder are always considered filterable.

(* Show target kind as lowercase, English words. *)
val string_of_kind : target_kind -> string

(*
   Scan a list of folders or files recursively and return a list of files
   in the requested language. This takes care of ignoring undesirable
   files, which are returned in the semgrep-core response format.

   Reasons for skipping a file include currently:
   - the file looks like it's the wrong language.
   - a 'skip_list.txt' file was found at a conventional location (see
     skip_list.ml in pfff).
   - files over a certain size.

   By default files are sorted alphabetically. Setting
   'sort_by_decr_size' will sort them be decreasing size instead.

   This is a replacement for Lang.files_of_dirs_or_files.

val files_of_dirs_or_files :
  ?sort_by_decr_size:bool ->
  Lang.t ->
  (Common.path * target_kind) list ->
  Common.filename list * Semgrep_core_response_t.skipped_target list

(*
   Sort files by decreasing size. This is meant for optimizing
   CPU usage when processing targets in parallel on a fixed number of cores.
*)
val sort_by_decreasing_size : Common.filename list -> Common.filename list

(* Stats used internally to detect minified files *)
type whitespace_stat = { sample_size : int; ws_freq : float; line_freq : float }

(*
   Return file size and frequency of whitespace bytes.
   This is intended for calibrating the heuristic used to detect
   minified files.
