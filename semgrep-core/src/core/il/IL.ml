(* Intermediate Language (IL) for static analysis.
 *
 * Just like for the CST -> AST, the goal of an AST -> IL transformation
 * is to simplify things even more for program analysis purposes.
 *
 * Here are the simplifications done compared to the generic AST:
 *  - intermediate 'instr' type (instr for instruction), for expressions with
 *    side effects and statements without any control flow,
 *    moving Assign/Seq/Call/Conditional out of 'expr' and
 *    moving Assert out of 'stmt'
 *  - new expression type 'exp' for side-effect free expressions
 *  - intermediate 'lvalue' type; expressions are split into
 *    lvalue vs regular expressions, moved Dot/Index out of expr
 *
 *  - Assign/Calls are now instructions, not expressions, and no more Seq
 *  - no AssignOp, or Decr/Incr, just Assign
 *  - Lambdas are now instructions (not nested again)
 *
 *  - no For/Foreach/DoWhile/While, converted all to Loop,
 *  - no Foreach, converted to a Loop and 2 new special
 *  - no Switch, converted to Ifs
 *  - no Continue/Break, converted to goto
 *  - less use of expr option (in Return/Assert/...), use Unit in those cases
 *
 *  - no Sgrep constructs
 *  - Naming has been performed, no more ident vs name
 *
 * TODO:
 *   - TODO? have all arguments of Calls be variables?
 *
 *
 * Note that we still want to be close to the original code so that
 * error reported on the IL can be mapped back to error on the original code
 * (source "maps"), or more importantly semantic information computed
 * on the IL (e.g., types, svalue) can be mapped back to the generic AST.
 * This is why you will see some 'eorig', 'iorig' fields below and the use of
 * refs such as svalue shared with the generic AST.
 *
 * history:
 *  - cst_php.ml (was actually called ast_php.ml)
 *  - ast_php.ml (was called ast_php_simple.ml)
 *  - pil.ml, still for PHP
 *  - IL.ml for AST generic
 *
 * related work:
 *  - CIL, C Intermediate Language, Necula et al, CC'00
 *  - RIL, The Ruby Intermediate Language, Furr et al, DLS'09
 *  - SIL? in Infer? or more a generic AST than a generic IL?
 *  - Rust IL?
 *  - C-- in OCaml? too low-level?
 *  - LLVM IR (but too far away from original code? complicated
 *    source maps)
 *  - BRIL https://capra.cs.cornell.edu/bril/ used for teaching
 *  - gcc RTL (too low-level? similar to 3-address code?)
 *  - SiMPL language in BAP/BitBlaze dynamic analysis libraries
 *    but probably too close to assembly/bytecode
 *  - Jimpl in Soot/Wala

 * can become control-flow sensitive? (e.g., DOOP)

(* Mapping back to Generic *)
(*****************************************************************************)

(* Only use `SameAs` when the IL expression or instruction is indeed "the same as"
 * (i.e., semantically equivalent to) that Generic expression.
 *
 * When an IL expression is derived from some other Generic expression or
 * construct, but not semantically equivalent, you can use `Related`. Note that
 * this info will be used by taint-tracking to match sources/sanitizers/sinks;
 * so make sure that the annotation makes sense, or it could lead to weird taint
 * findings.
 *
 * When no orig info is needed, or it cannot be provided, then use NoOrig. For
 * example, auxiliary assignments where the RHS has the right orig-info can be
 * annotated with NoOrig. This also helps making -dump_il more readable.

   *  packages, modules, namespaces depending on the type of 'var' above.
