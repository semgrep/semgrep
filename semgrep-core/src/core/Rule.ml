    Without this, `$F(...)` would automatically sanitize any other function
    call acting as a sink or a source.

 sure to be honest, I think we will have to gain some experience in using labels
 first. Sanitizers do allow you to completely remove taint from data, although I
 think that can be simulated with labels too. We could translate (internally)
 `pattern-sanitizers` as `pattern-sources` with a `"__SANITIZED__"` label, and
 then rewrite the `requires` of all sinks as `(...) not __SANITIZED__`. But
 not-conflicting sanitizers cannot be simulated that way. That said, I think we
 should replace not-conflicting sanitizers with some `options:`, because they are
 a bit confusing to use sometimes. *)
