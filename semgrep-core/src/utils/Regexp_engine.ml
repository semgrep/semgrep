(*****************************************************************************)
(* Small wrapper to the actual regexp engine(s).
 *
 * Regexps are used in many places in Semgrep:
 *  - in Generic_vs_generic to support the "=~/.../",
 *  - in Semgrep.ml for the metavariable-regexp and pattern-regexp
 *  - in Optimizing/ for skipping rules or target files
 *    (See Analyze_pattern.ml for more information).
 *  - TODO for include/exclude globbing
 *
 * notes: I tried to use the ocaml-re (Re) regexp libray instead of Str
 * because I thought it would be faster, and because it offers regexp
 * combinators (alt, rep, etc.) which might be useful at some point to
 * handle patterns containing explicit DisjExpr or for Analyze_rule.ml.
 * However when running on Zulip codebase with zulip semgrep rules,
 * Str is actually faster than Re.
 *
 * alternatives:
 *  - Str: simple, builtin
 *  - Re: provides alt() to build complex regexp, and also pure OCaml
 *    implem which is great in a JSOO context, but it seems slower.
 *    Can also support globbing with the Re.Glob module!
 *  - PCRE: powerful, but C dependency
 *
 * TODO:
 *  - move the regexp-related code in Generic_vs_generic here!
 *  - use Re.Glob just for globbing?
 *
