   Hack used for -filter_irrelevant_rules and metavariable-regex.

   We want to translate a regexp meant to match a metavariable into a regexp
   that matches at least in the same spots when applied to the whole
   target file. It may match more but not less.

   Rewrite a pattern to remove assertions that match the beginning or the
   end of strings. This is done to patterns that apply to a substring
   of the target file (the value of a metavariable) because e.g. ^
   matches at the beginning of the substring but not match at the same
   location in the target file.

   The built-in assertions that match the beginning or the end of a string
   are: ^ $ \A \Z \z
   If we're not sure whether these assertions were removed, the result
   is None. For example the pattern '(?:a|^)' requires proper parsing
   and analysis to rewrite it as '(?:a|(?<=\n))', while '[^x]' and
   '[a-z^]' should be left untouched. In those cases where '^' is present but
   not at the beginning or end of the pattern, the result of the function
   will be None.
