(* OCaml has generative functors.
   This means that abstract types minted from different applications of the same
   functor are _always_ different, even if they are constructed in the exact
   same way.
   So different instances of the module `MkId` will have distinct types.
   This helps us not conflate types when we need a new kind of unique identifier type,
   and avoid boilerplate code with refs and counters.
