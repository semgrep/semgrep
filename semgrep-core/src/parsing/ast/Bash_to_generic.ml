(*
   Convert Bash-specific AST to generic AST.

   A Bash program is organized into the following hierarchy:

   - List: a list of pipelines. A whole program is a list.

       echo hello | tr h y; echo bye

   - Pipeline: a list of commands whose standard output and input are
     connected

       echo hello | tr h y

   - Command: everything else including calls to external programs and
     control structures that the language has to offer.

     Simple command:

       echo hello

     For loop, a compound command:

       for i in 1 2 3; do echo "$i"; done

     Variable assignment:

       answer=42

     + many others

   - Literals: space-separated elements within a simple command, which will
     be expanded into a possibly different number of elements.

       hello
       "$x"
       $items
       "$(cat foo/bar)"
       $?

       etc.

   Mapping to the generic AST:

   pipeline -> pipeline statement, made of a sequence of statements
   command -> statement
   simple command -> function call, which is an expression
   variable assignment -> variable assignment
   function definition -> function definition
   for loop -> for loop, which is a statement
