(* Analyzing a semgrep rule for optimization purpose.
 *
 * Analyze_pattern.ml tries to extract a regexp from a pattern
 * in order to skip certain target files. However, it processes only
 * one pattern at a time and is not aware of the context in which this
 * pattern is used. For example in:
 *
 *  id: eval-not-in-foo
 *  patterns:
 *    - pattern: eval(...)
 *    - pattern-not:
 *        require("foo.js")
 *        ...
 *
 * the current Mini_rules_filter used in Match_patterns will just see a flat
 * list of patterns, and will look separately for 'eval' and 'foo.js'
 * and filter certain patterns; But really, even if 'foo.js' is mentioned
 * in a file, we should completly skip the file if 'eval' is not in the file
 * because after all 'foo.js' is mentioned in a pattern-not context!
 * The goal of this file is to process a rule holistically to
 * overcome the limitations of Analyze_pattern.ml
 *
 * There are many optimization opportunities when semgrep-core can see
 * the whole rule:
 *  - skip the pattern-not when computing the regexp
 *  - TODO if a pattern is very general (e.g., $FOO()), but is
 *    also mentioned in a metavariable-regexp, then we can use this
 *    regexp to filter the rule/target file.
 *  - TODO if a pattern is very general (e.g., $PROP), but reference
 *    metavariables used in all the patterns of a disjunction, then you
 *    can skip this pattern
 *)

(*****************************************************************************)
(* Types *)
(*****************************************************************************)

(* Conjunctive normal form (CNF).
 *
 * Why a CNF instead of a DNF (Disjunctive normal form)?
 * Because in the context of producing a regexp, regexps are good at
 * representing Or, but not so great for And.
 *
 * todo? the evaluation engine prefers to work on DNF where negation
 * must be inside a And, so maybe better to work also on DNF here?
 * and skip correctly the negations?
 *
 * update: I now use run_cnf_step2 to eval a cnf, so I could do it
 * on a DNF too because I don't anymore reduce everything to a single regexp
 * (it's fast enough to run many regexps on a file).
 *

(* NOTE "AND vs OR and map_filter":
 * We cannot use `Common.map_filter` for `R.Or`, because it has the wrong
 * semantics. We use `None` to say "we can't handle this", or in other words,
 * "we assume this pattern can match", or just "true"! So in an AND we can
 * remove those "true" terms, but in an OR we need to reduce the entire OR to
 * "true". Therefore, `Common.map_filter` works for AND-semantics, but for
 * OR-semantics we need `option_map`. *)

(* Step0: a complex formula to a CNF *)
(*****************************************************************************)
(* Transforming a complex formula to a simple CNF formula.
 *
 * old: I used to do the CNF transformation while still having negations in the
 * formula, and later in step1 remove the Not. However, this does not work!
 * Indeed, in:
 *    (foo/\not xxx) \/ (bar/\not yyy),
 * we should analyze a file if 'foo' *or* 'bar' are in the file. However,
 * the CNF transformation would distribute the \/ with:
 *    (foo\/bar) /\ (foo\/not yyy) /\ (not xxx\/bar) /\ (not xxx\/not yyy)
 * but then in step1 if we remove the not, we get:
 *    (foo\/bar) /\ foo /\ bar
 * and suddently we strongly require 'foo' *and* 'bar' to be in the file.
 * Thus, we must filter the Not before doing the CNF conversion!
