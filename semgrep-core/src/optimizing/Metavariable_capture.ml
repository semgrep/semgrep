(*
     To be called as early as possible after passing a backreference
     which may no longer be needed when descending down the pattern.
     For now, we call this only when reaching a new stmt pattern node.

     For simplicity, we assume any member of 'min_env' may no longer be
     needed. It may be more efficient to accumulate the backreferences
     that were encountered since the last stmt and only consider removing
     their bindings, rather than considering all the bindings in min_env.

     If we don't call this, the cache keys will be overspecified, reducing
     or preventing reuse.
