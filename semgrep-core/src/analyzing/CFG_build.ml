(* Algorithm *)
(*****************************************************************************)

(* The CFG building algorithm works by iteratively visiting the
 * statements in the AST of a function. At each statement,
 * the cfg_stmt function is called, and passed the index of the;
 * previous node (if there is one), and returns a cfg_stmt_result.
 *
 * Function cfg_stmt_list is the one responsible for labeling nodes.
 * We do everything in one pass by collecting the list of gotos and
 * resolving them at the end. Alternatively, we could do it in two
 * passes, with the first pass doing the labeling work.
 *
 * history:
 * - ver1: old code was returning a nodei, but break has no end, so
 *   cfg_stmt should return a nodei option.
 * - ver2: old code was taking a nodei, but should also take a nodei
 *   option. There can be deadcode in the function.
 * - ver3: In order to handle labels/gotos the now return either a
 *   label or a pair nodei * nodei option (entry and exit).
 *
 * subtle: try/throw. The current algo is not very precise, but
 * it's probably good enough for many analysis.
 *)
