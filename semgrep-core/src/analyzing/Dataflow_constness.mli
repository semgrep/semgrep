val update_constness : IL.cfg -> mapping -> unit
(**
 * Updates the [IL.lval.constness] refs according to the mapping.
 * Note that the constness refs in IL are shared with the Generic AST, so
 * running this analysis also updates constness info in the Generic AST.
 * The update respects previous constant propagation passes, updating
 * constness info when we have deduced more specific facts, but leaving it
 * untouched otherwise.
