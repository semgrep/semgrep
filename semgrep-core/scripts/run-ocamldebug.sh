ocamldebug hints:
* info modules: List all program modules.  Helpful to get their names.
* break @ [<module>] <line>: Insert breakpoint at line.
  - NOTE: Always defaults to frame 0 module even after "up"!
  - Sometimes has to be placed on the preceding line to work.
* break [<module>.]<function>: Break at function.
  - Must run program first, e.g.: "r", "break ...", "g 0", "r", "up"... .
  - Useful breakpoint: OUnit.assert_failure (or Alcotest equivalent)
* r[un], s[tep], n[ext]: gdb-like program running.
* bt, frame, up, down: gdb-like call stack navigation.
* g[oto] <n>: Jump forward or backward in time.
* print <var>: Print a variable.
* fin[ish]: Run until current function returns.
* print *: Print the most recent function result (e.g., after finish).
* list [startline [endline]]: Print source code around current location.
* help [<command>]: List commands or info about one.
* quit: Exit (also Ctrl-D).
