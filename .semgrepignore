# Items added to this file will be ignored by Semgrep.
#
# This file uses .gitignore syntax:
#
# To ignore a file anywhere it occurs in your project, enter a
# glob pattern here. E.g. "*.min.js".
#
# To ignore a directory anywhere it occurs in your project, add
# a trailing slash to the file name. E.g. "dist/".
#
# To ignore a file or directory only relative to the project root,
# include a slash anywhere except the last character. E.g.
# "/dist/", or "src/generated".
#
# Some parts of .gitignore syntax are not supported, and patterns
# using this syntax will be dropped from the ignore list:
# - Explicit "include syntax", e.g. "!kept/".
# - Multi-character expansion syntax, e.g. "*.py[cod]"
# To include ignore patterns from another file, start a line
# with ':include', followed by the path of the file. E.g.
# ":include path/to/other/ignore/file".
# UPDATE: this will not be be needed in osemgrep which supports
# all of the .gitignore syntax (!kept/, *.py[cod])
#
# To ignore a file with a literal ':' character, escape it with
# a backslash, e.g. "\:foo".
