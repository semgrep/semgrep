(* Small wrapper around the 'git' command-line program.
 *
 * alternatives:
 *  - use https://github.com/fxfactorial/ocaml-libgit2, but
 *    pysemgrep uses 'git' directly so easier for now to just imitate.
 *    Morever we need services like 'git ls-files' and this
 *    does not seem to be supported by libgit.
 *  - use https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-git, which implements
 *    git purely in OCaml, but this currently seems to support only
 *    the "core" of git, not all the "porcelain" around such as
 *    'git ls-files' that we need.
 *
 * TODO:
 *  - use Bos uniformly instead of Common.cmd_to_list and Lwt_process.
 *  - be more consistent and requires an Fpath instead
 *    of relying sometimes on cwd.
