   `git worktree` is doing 90% of the heavy lifting here. Docs:
   https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree

   In short, git allows you to have multiple working trees checked out at
   the same time. This means you can essentially have X different
   branches/commits checked out from the same repo, in different locations

   Different worktrees share the same .git directory, so this is a lot
   faster/cheaper than cloning the repo multiple times

   This also allows us to not worry about git state, since
   unstaged/staged files are not shared between worktrees. This means we
   don't need to git stash anything, or expect a clean working tree.
