(* Prelude *)
(*****************************************************************************)
(*
 * A program can be seen as a hierarchy of entities
 * (directory/package/module/file/class/function/method/field/...)
 * linked to each other through different mechanisms
 * (import/reference/extend/implement/instantiate/call/access/...).
 * This module is the basis for 'codegraph', a tool to help
 * visualize code dependencies or code relationships.
 * It provides one of the core data structure of codegraph
 * an (hyper)graph of all the entities in a program linked
 * either via a 'has-a' relation, which represent the
 * hierarchies (in the sense of containment, not inheritance), or
 * 'use-a', which represent the dependencies
 * (the other core data structure of codegraph is in
 * dependencies_matrix_code.ml).
 *
 * Is this yet another code database? For PHP we already have
 * database_php.ml, tags_php.ml, database_light_php.ml,
 * and now even a Prolog database, ... that's a lot of code database.
 * They all have things in common, but by focusing here on one thing,
 * by just having a single graph, it's then
 * easier to reason and implement certain features.
 * I could have probably done the DSM using database_php.ml
 * but it was not made for that. Here the graph is
 * the core and simplest data structure that is needed.
 *
 * This graph also unifies many things. For instance there is no
 * special code to handle directories or files, they are
 * just considered regular entities like module or classes
 * and can have sub-entities. Moreover like database_light.ml,
 * this file is language independent so one can have one tool
 * that can handle ML, PHP, C++, etc.
 *
 * todo:
 *  - how to handle duplicate entities (e.g. we can have two different
 *    files with the same module name, or two functions with the same
 *    name but one in a library and the other in a script).
 *    prepend a ___number suffix?
 *    Or just have one node with multiple parents :) But having
 *    multiple parents would not solve the problem because then
 *    an edge will increment unrelated cells in the DSM.
 *
 *  - change API to allow by default to automatically create nodes
 *    when create edges with unexisting nodes? After all graphviz
 *    allow to specify graphs like this, which shorten graph
 *    description significantly. Can still have a
 *    add_edge_throw_exn_if_not_present for the cases where we
 *    want extra security.
 *
 *  - maybe I can generate the light database from this graph_code.ml
 *    (I already do a bit for prolog with graph_code_prolog.ml)
 *
 *  - opti: faster implem of parent? have a lock_graph() that forbid any
 *    further modifications on Has but then provide optimized operations
 *    like parent the precompute or memoize the parent relation
 *
 * related work:
