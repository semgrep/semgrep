(* This module governs a path type, which can only produce values which
   are for normalized paths to existent files or directories.
   These paths are always canonically kept at their absolute forms, in order to
   maintain a canonicity property. Due to the `Path` constructor being private, we
   can enforce this invariant at the type level.

   This file was originally called `Path.ml`, but this conflicts with
   the OCaml compiler libraries.
