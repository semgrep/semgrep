(*
   Fast check that tells whether a pattern has any chance of matching the
   document with 'Match.search'.

   In the future, it may be superseded by an equivalent pre-parse
   optimization that operates directly on the source files rather than the
   AST. It would be better since it turns out parsing is usually more
   expensive than matching, and that would allow skipping the parsing step.
   See https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/3461

(*
   Check if the pattern contains 'Byte' tokens, since they often don't
   and the target may contain many of them. This is meant as an optimization
   to avoid making many useless table lookups when scanning the target.
