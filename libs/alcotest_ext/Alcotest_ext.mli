   A test is a name and a function that raises exceptions to signal
   test failure.

   There are two main recommended ways of writing a test:

   1. With 'assert false':

   Each test may use 'assert false' to indicate that the test doesn't pass.
   This is the simplest way of failing while also showing the location
   of the failure. When using 'assert false', you should print the expected
   value and actual value if applicable.

   2. With 'Alcotest.(check ...)':

   This is a little nicer because the error messages prints something like
   "Expecting 'foo', got 'bar'". However, this makes tests more complicated
   to write. If the test already prints the expected value and the actual
   value as its output, it's just easier to fail with 'assert false'.

   In any case, Alcotest will capture the output (stdout, stderr) of each
   test and put it in its own file so we can consult it later. Don't
   hesitate to log a lot during the execution of the test.

  (* Hash of the full name of the test, computed automatically. *)
  id : string;
  (* Categories are made for organizing tests as a tree which is useful
     for display and filtering. A new category is created typically when
     grouping multiple test suites into one with 'pack_suites'.
     e.g. ["food"; "fruit"; "kiwi"] *)
  category : string list;
  name : string;
  func : unit -> 'a;
  (***** Options *****)
  tags : string list; (* tags must be declared using 'declare_tag' *)
  (* special "tag" supported directly by Alcotest: *)
  speed_level : Alcotest.speed_level;
  check_output : output;
  (* The 'skipped' property causes a test to be skipped by Alcotest but still
     shown as "[SKIP]" rather than being omitted. *)

}

type test = unit t

(* Legacy type that doesn't support options *)
type simple_test = string * (unit -> unit)

(* Lwt.t promises transpiled to JS via jsoo must have their Lwt.t nature
   hoisted all the way to the top level, so we can run them properly on the
   JS runtime.
   When running such tests in JS, we need our tests to also return promises.
*)
type lwt_test = unit Lwt.t t

(*
   Tags are strings, which is nice and extensible, but to prevent misspellings,
   we require them to be registered using 'declare_tag'.

   The validity of tags is checked at the time of test creation.
*)
val declare_tag : string -> unit
val list_valid_tags : unit -> string list
val has_tag : string -> 'a t -> bool

(*
   Create a test to appear in a test suite.
*)
val create :
  ?category:string list ->
  ?check_output:output ->
  ?skipped:bool ->
  ?speed_level:Alcotest.speed_level ->
  ?tags:string list ->
  string ->
  (unit -> 'a) ->
  'a t

(*
   Update some of the test's fields. This ensures that the 'id' is recomputed
   correctly.
*)
val update :
  ?category:string list ->
  ?check_output:output ->
  ?func:(unit -> 'a) ->
  ?name:string ->
  ?skipped:bool ->
  ?speed_level:Alcotest.speed_level ->
  ?tags:string list ->
  'a t ->
  'a t

(* Convert legacy optionless format to new format *)
val simple_test : string * (unit -> 'a) -> 'a t
val simple_tests : (string * (unit -> 'a)) list -> 'a t list

(* Register a test. The test gets added to the global list of tests.
   This is meant to declare inline tests as follows:

     let () = Alcotest_ext.test "foo" (fun () ->
       (* test body raising exceptions to signal failure *)
       ...
     )
*)
val test :
  ?check_output:output ->
  ?speed_level:Alcotest.speed_level ->
  string ->
  (unit -> unit) ->
  unit

val test_lwt :
  ?check_output:output ->
  ?speed_level:Alcotest.speed_level ->
  string ->
  (unit -> unit Lwt.t) ->
  unit

(* Get the list of registered tests. *)
val get_registered_tests : unit -> test list
val get_registered_lwt_tests : unit -> lwt_test list

(*
   Usage:

     pack_tests_pro "apples" [test_color; test_juiciness]
     pack_suites "fruit" [apple_tests; banana_tests; strawberry_tests]
*)
val pack_tests_pro : string -> 'a t list -> 'a t list
val pack_suites : string -> 'a t list list -> 'a t list

(* Legacy interface. It's fine to keep using it but it doesn't allow
   defining tests with special options such as capturing and checking stdout. *)
val pack_tests : string -> (string * (unit -> 'a)) list -> 'a t list

(*
   Sort tests by path, alphabetically:

     "a>b" comes before "a>c",
     "a>b" come before "a b".

   Non-ascii path components are sorted by byte order, possibly giving
   unexpected results.
*)
val sort : 'a t list -> 'a t list

(*
   Alcotest.test is a list of Alcotest.test_case, so we need to assign
   a test suite name to each test. This is done as follows:

     "Foo>Bar>hello" -> suite name = "Foo>Bar", test name = "hello"

   The speed level is set to either `Quick or `Slow for all the tests.
   The default is `Quick.

   Basic usage:

     let alcotest_tests = to_alcotest my_quick_tests

   Advanced usage with slow (background) tests:

     let alcotest_tests =
       to_alcotest ~speed_level:`Quick my_quick_tests
       @ to_alcotest ~speed_level:`Slow my_slow_tests
*)
val to_alcotest : test list -> unit Alcotest.test list
val to_alcotest_lwt : lwt_test list -> unit Alcotest_lwt.test list
