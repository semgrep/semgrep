(*
   Mixed bag of types used by most modules of the library, including private
   modules.

   Some of these types are exported by the main module Alcotest_ext.
   Feel free to isolate types in their own modules if it makes things clearer.

(*
   There are four statuses for a completed test, like in pytest:

   Should_succeed, Succeded -> PASS (good)
   Should_succeed, Failed -> FAIL (bad)
   Should_fail, Failed -> XFAIL (good)
   Should_fail, Succeeded -> XPASS (bad)

   When running a test suite, it's considered a success if all the tests
   complete with status PASS or XFAIL.
*)
(* private *)
type outcome = Succeeded | Failed

(* private *)
type captured_output =
  | Ignored
  | Captured_stdout of string
  | Captured_stderr of string
  | Captured_stdout_stderr of string * string
  | Captured_merged of string

(* private *)
type result = { outcome : outcome; captured_output : captured_output }

(* public *)
type expected_outcome =
  | Should_succeed
  | Should_fail of string (* explains why we expect this test to fail *)

(*
   The expected output is optional so as to allow new tests for which
   there's no expected output yet but there's an expected outcome defined
   in the test suite.
*)
(* private? (part of test status) *)
type expectation = {
  expected_outcome : expected_outcome;
  expected_output : (captured_output, string) Result.t;
}

(*
   Usually, a successful status is one where both result and expectation
   are not None and are identical. It can be useful to distinguish various
   other statuses such as: missing expectation, missing result, xpass
   (success when expected outcome was Failed), ...
*)
type status = { expectation : expectation; result : (result, string) Result.t }

(* A summary of the 'status' object using the same language as pytest.

   PASS: expected success, actual success
   FAIL: expected success, actual failure
   XFAIL: expected failure, actual failure
   XPASS: expected failure, actual success
   MISS: missing data

   Maximum string length for display: 5 characters

     for referencing tests in filters and in file names.
