(*
   A monad-like structure that
   - is limited to wrapping the 'unit' type;
   - provides an exception catcher 'catch'.

   It is designed for wrapping a sequence of tests that provide their result
   by either returning (success) or by raising an exception (failure).
   This wrapping allows asynchronous computations i.e. allows running
   a sequence of tests interleaved with other computations. While such
   concurrency is not a property we need for running a test suite,
   it is necessary due to environments where we can't turn asynchronous
   computations into synchronous ones such as JavaScript.
