# This script is a substitute for a symbolic link to the executable created
# by dune. The problems we're working around are:
# 1. dune fails on dangling symlinks so we can't just symlink to 'test.exe'.
# 2. 'dune runtest' doesn't run in the directory it's called from but in a
#    copy, causing the test workspace to be in a temporary, hidden copy under
#    dune's '_build" folder.
