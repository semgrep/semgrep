The status of completed tests is reported below as one of four kinds:
- PASS: a successful test that was expected to succeed (good);
- FAIL: a failing test that was expected to succeed (needs fixing);
- XFAIL: a failing test that was expected to fail (tolerated failure);
- XPASS: a successful test that was expected to fail (progress?).
Other states:
- MISS: a test that never ran;
- xxxx*: a new test for which the expected output is missing.
  In this case, you should review the test output and run the 'approve'
  subcommand once you're satisfied with the output.

The status of completed tests is reported below as one of four kinds:
- PASS: a successful test that was expected to succeed (good);
- FAIL: a failing test that was expected to succeed (needs fixing);
- XFAIL: a failing test that was expected to fail (tolerated failure);
- XPASS: a successful test that was expected to fail (progress?).
Other states:
- MISS: a test that never ran;
- xxxx*: a new test for which the expected output is missing.
  In this case, you should review the test output and run the 'approve'
  subcommand once you're satisfied with the output.
