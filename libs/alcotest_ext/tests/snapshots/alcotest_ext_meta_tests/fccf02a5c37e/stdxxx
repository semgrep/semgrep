The status of completed tests is reported below as one of four kinds:
- PASS: a successful test that was expected to succeed (good);
- FAIL: a failing test that was expected to succeed (needs fixing);
- XFAIL: a failing test that was expected to fail (tolerated failure);
- XPASS: a successful test that was expected to fail (progress?).
Other states:
- MISS: a test that never ran;
- xxxx*: a new test for which the expected output is missing.
  In this case, you should review the test output and run the 'approve'
  subcommand once you're satisfied with the output.

- FAIL: a failing test that was expected to succeed (needs fixing);
- XFAIL: a failing test that was expected to fail (tolerated failure);
