(*
   Operations on files in the general sense (regular file, folder, etc.).

   Migration note:
   - step 1: here, we expose the same functions as in Common but using the
             Fpath.t type.
   - step 2: move the original implementation from Common.ml to here
             and stop using 'string' for file paths.
*)

(*
   Extended version of Fpath.

   Provides operations on file system paths only, without any access
   to the file system.
*)
module Path : sig
  include module type of Fpath

  (*
    Extra utilities to convert between lists of files between
    string and Fpath.t without having to write
    'Common.map Fpath.v ...' every time.

    For converting a single path, use Fpath.v and Fpath.to_string directly.

    of_strings, like Fpath.v which it uses, will raise an exception
    in case of a malformed path such as "" or "foo\000bar".

    Performance notes:
    - these operations involve creating a new list.
    - converting a path to a string is assumed to be cheap since Fpath.t
      internally is a string.
    - converting a string to a path involves validating the path syntax,
      which is more expensive.

     my-ocaml-program <(echo contents)
