(* Replacement for 'Common.hd_exn "unexpected empty list"', which returns the
   first element of a list or
   fails with an unhelpful exception. 'Common.hd_exn msg []' will raise
   the exception 'Failure msg' which is only a slight improvement over
   'Common.hd_exn "unexpected empty list"'.

   In general, you should prefer a match-with and not have to call a
   function to extract the first element of a list.

   Usage: Common.hd_exn "found an empty list of things" xs

   If receiving an empty list is a bug, prefer the following:

     match xs with
     | [] -> assert false
     | xs -> ...

(* Replacement for 'Common.tl_exn "unexpected empty list"' but not a great

val map2 : ('a -> 'b -> 'c) -> 'a list -> 'b list -> 'c list
