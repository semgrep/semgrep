(* Like 'String.sub', extract a substring from a string by specifying
   the start index and the length of the substring.

   This function won't raise out-of-range exceptions:
   - Requesting a substring of negative length is the same as requesting an
     empty substring.
   - The result is the overlap between the string's range and the substring's
     imaginary range.

   For example, 'safe_sub "abc" (-1) 3' is '"ab"'.

val safe_sub : string -> int -> int -> string

(*
   Print an escaped and quoted string, truncating it to show at most max_len
   bytes. The length in bytes is printed if the string has to be truncated.
   The default value for max_len is 200.
   This function is intended for logs.

(* Returns the entirety of all of the lines in the given string that are
 * included in the given range. Strips trailing newline characters from each
 * line. See unit tests for examples. *)
