(*
   Remove overlapping edits by proceeding from left to right in the order
   the edits are given to us.

   This is an O(N^2) algorithm where N is the number of edits. It should be
   small enough in practice since N is the number of edits to make in one
   file. If it turns out this isn't good enough, we'll have to use a more
   elaborate algorithm. The problem is that we have to apply the fixes
   in the order in which they're discovered by semgrep rules rather than
   than in the order in which they appear in the file.
