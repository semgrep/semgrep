(* OCaml has generative functors.
   This means that abstract types minted from different applications of the same
   functor are _always_ different, even if they are constructed in the exact
   same way.
   So different instances of the module `MkId` will have distinct types.
   This helps us not conflate types when we need a new kind of unique identifier type,
   and avoid boilerplate code with refs and counters.

  (* Why not just type t [@@deriving ord]?
   *
   * For some reason, ppx derives a function that allocates a closure
   * unnecessarily, causing IL.compare_name to be responsible for
   * ~7% of all allocations throughout a semgrep run!

   * default) and move downward. *)
