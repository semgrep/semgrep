(*
 * OCaml hacks to support reflection.
 *
 * OCaml does not support reflection, and it's a good thing: we love
 * strong type-checking that forbids too clever hacks like 'eval', or
 * run-time reflection; it's too much power for you, you will misuse
 * it. At the same time it's sometimes useful. So at least we could make
 * it possible to still reflect on the type definitions or values in
 * OCaml source code. We can do it by processing ML source code and
 * emitting ML source code containing under the form of regular ML
 * value or functions meta-information about information in other
 * source code files. It's a little bit a poor's man reflection mechanism,
 * because it's more manual, but it's for the best. Metaprogramming had
 * to be painful, because it is dangerous!
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *      TODO
 *
 * In some sense we reimplement what is in the OCaml compiler, which
 * contains the full AST of OCaml source code. But the OCaml compiler
 * and its AST are too big, too scary for many tasks that would be satisfied
 * by a restricted but simpler AST.
 *
 * Camlp4 is obviously also a solution to this problem, but it has a
 * learning curve, and it's a slightly different world than the pure
 * regular OCaml world. So this module, and ocamltarzan together can
 * reduce the problem by taking the best of camlp4, while still
 * avoiding it.
 *
 * The support is partial. We support only the OCaml constructions
 * we found the most useful for programming stuff like
 * stub generators.
 *
 * less? not all OCaml so call it miniml.ml  ? or reflection.ml ?
 *
 *
 * Notes: 2 worlds
 *   - the type level world,
 *   - the data level world
 *
 * Then there is whether the code is generated on the fly, or output somewhere
 * to be compiled and linked again (so 2 steps process, more manual, but
 * arguably less complicated magic)
 *
 * different level of (meta)programming:
 *
 *  - programming in OCaml on OCaml values (classic)
 *  - programming in OCaml on Sexp.t value of value
 *  - programming in OCaml on Sexp.t value of type description
 *  - programming in OCaml on OCaml.v value of value
 *  - programming in OCaml on OCaml.t value of type description
 *
 * Depending on what you have to do, some levels are more suited than other.
 * For instance to do a show, to pretty print value, then sexp is good,
 * because really you just want to write code that handle 2 cases,
 * atoms and list. That's really what pretty printing is all about. You
 * could write a pretty printer for OCaml.v, but it will need to handle
 * 10 cases. Now if you want to write a code generator for python, or an ORM,
 * then OCaml.v is better than sexp, because in sexp you lost some valuable
 * information (that you may have to reverse engineer, like whether
 * a Sexp.List corresponds to a field, or a sum, or wether something is
 * null or an empty list, or wether it's an int or float, etc).
 *
 * Another way to do (meta)programming is:
 *  - programming in Camlp4 on OCaml ast
 *  - writing camlmix code to generate code.
 *
 * notes:
 *  - sexp value or sexp of type description, not as precise, but easier to
 *    write really generic code that do not need to have more information
 *    about the sexp nodes (such as wether it's a field, a constuctor, etc)
 *  - miniml value or type, not as precise that the regular type,
 *    but more precise than sexp, and allow write some generic code.
 *  - ocaml value (not type as you cant program at type level),
 *    precise type checking, but can be tedious to write generic
 *    code like generic visitors or pickler/unpicklers
 *
 * This file is working with ocamltarzan/pa/pa_type.ml (and so indirectly
 * it is working with camlp4).
 *
 * Note that can even generate sexp_of_x for miniML :) really
 * reflexive tower here
 *
 * Note that even if this module helps a programmer to avoid
 * using directly camlp4 to auto generate some code, it can
 * not solve all the tasks.
 *
 * history:
 *  - Thought about it when wanting to do the ast_php.ml to be
 *    transformed into a .adsl declaration to be able to generate
 *    corresponding python classes using astgen.py.
 *  - Thought about a miniMLType and miniMLValue, and then realize
 *    that that was maybe what code in the ocaml-orm-sqlite
 *    was doing (type-of et value-of), except I wanted the
 *    ocamltarzan style of meta-programming instead of the camlp4 one.
 *
 *
 * Alternatives:
 *  - camlp4
 *    obviously camlp4 has access to the full AST of OCaml, but
 *    that is one pb, that's too much. We often want only to do
 *    analysis on the type
 *  - type-conv
 *    good, but force to use camlp4. Can use the generic sexplib
 *    and then work on the generated sexp, but as explained below,
 *    is will be on the value.
 *  - use lib-sexp (just the sexp library part, not the camlp4 support part)
 *    but not enough info. Even if usually
 *    can reverse engineer the sexp to rediscover the type,
 *    you will reverse engineer a value; what you want
 *    is the sexp representation of the type! not a value of this type.
 *    Also lib-sexp autogenerated code can be hard to understand, especially
 *    if the type definition is complex. A good side effect of ocaml.ml
 *    is that it provides an intermediate step :) So even if you
 *    could pretty print value from your def to sexp directly, you could
 *    also use transform your value into a OCaml.v, then use
 *    the somehow more readable function that translate a v into a sexp,
 *    and same when wanting to read a value from a sexp, by using
 *    again OCaml.v as an intermediate. It's nevertheless obviously
 *    less efficient.
 *
 *  - zephyr, or thrift ?
 *  - F# ?
 *  - Lisp/Scheme ?
 *  - .Net interoperability
 *
 * UPDATE: only the 'v' type remains. For the 't' type see metagen/
 * or prefer to use otarzan and the generic ASC in semgrep.

(*
 * OCaml value pretty printer. A similar functionnality is provided by

 * sometimes it is useful to print values from a regular command
 * line program. You don't always want to run the ocaml interpreter (or
 * customized interpreter built by ocamlmktop), and type an expression
 * in to get the printed value.
 *
 * The v_of_xxx generated code by ocamltarzan is
 * the first part to make this possible. The function below
 * is the second part.
 *
 * The '@[', '@,', etc are Format printf tags. See the doc of the Format
 * module in the OCaml manual to understand their meaning. Mainly,
 * @[ and @] open and close a pretty print box, and '@ ' and '@,'
 * are to give breaking hints to the pretty printer.
 *
 * The output can be copy pasted in ML code directly, which can be
 * useful when you want to pattern match over complex ocaml value.
