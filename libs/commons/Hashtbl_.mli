(* Safe replacement for Hashtbl.find_all for OCaml < 5

   In Ocaml < 5, Hashtbl.find_all is not stack-safe and causes Semgrep
   crashes on some input. The alternative below should be used instead
   at least until we don't support OCaml 4.

   A hash table is an array of buckets. A bucket is a special list that holds
   the (key, value) pairs that share the same hashed key modulo the length
   of the array. The 'find_all' function filters this special list, giving
   the list of values whose key is equal to the requested key. The issue
   for us is that we can't reimplement 'find_all' without access to the
   concrete type of the buckets. To work around this, we combine all the
   values associated with a key into one mutable list (list ref).

   Compared to add/find_all, push/get_stack will keep only one
   copy of each key in the table. It reduces the number of calls to
   the 'equal' function when extracting the stack of values for a given
   key. See the original 'hashtbl.ml' in the OCaml distribution for more
   insight.

   push: add a value to the stack associated with a key.
   get_stack: get the stack associated with a key. Values are returned as
              a list, most recently-added first. Returns an empty list
              if the key is unbound.

   Feel free to add a 'pop' function if needed.

   Usage:

     let tbl = Hashtbl.create 100 in
     Hashtbl_.push tbl 42 "a";
     Hashtbl_.push tbl 17 "b";
     Hashtbl_.push tbl 42 "c";
     Hashtbl_.get_stack tbl 42 |> List.rev
*)
val push : ('k, 'v list ref) Hashtbl.t -> 'k -> 'v -> unit
val get_stack : ('k, 'v list ref) Hashtbl.t -> 'k -> 'v list
