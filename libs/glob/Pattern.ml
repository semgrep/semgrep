(* Prelude *)
(*****************************************************************************)
(* AST of a glob pattern.
 *
 * The main reference for this is:
 *  - https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore
 *    which itself relies partially on POSIX glob
 *  - https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/glob.7.html (man 7 glob)
 *
 * Examples:
 *  - *.c       # all local files with a '.c' extension
 *  - Thing.ml? # matches 'Thing.ml' as well as 'Thing.mli', 'Thing.mll', etc.
 *  - [a-z0-9]  # matches a single character in these ranges
 *  - /tmp/**   # all valid paths under '/tmp/'
 *
 * alternatives:
 *  -  Re.Glob from the ocaml-re library for parsing the patterns.
 *     But Re.Glob doesn't expose the AST of the glob pattern, and this prevents us
 *     from making transformations required by gitignore such as treating
 *     the pattern 'foo/bar' as equivalent to '/foo/bar' but not treat
 *     'foo' as '/foo'. However, we use ocaml-re in Match.ml
