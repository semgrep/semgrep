   This is tricky stuff.

   We have to make sure that timeout is not intercepted before here, so
   avoid exn handle such as try (...) with _ -> cos timeout will not bubble up
   enough. In such case, add a case before such as
   with Timeout -> raise Timeout | _ -> ...

  question: can we have a signal and so exn when in a exn handler ?
