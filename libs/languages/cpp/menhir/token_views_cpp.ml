(* Prelude  *)
(*****************************************************************************)
(*
 * This module makes it easier to write some fuzzy parsing heuristics
 * by offering different "views" over the same set of tokens.
 *
 * Normally I should not use ref/mutable in the token_extended type below
 * and instead have a set of functions taking a list of tokens and
 * returning a list of tokens. The problem is that to make easier some
 * functions, it is better to work on better representation, on "views"
 * over this list of tokens. But then modifying those views and get
 * back from those views to the original simple list of tokens is
 * tedious. One way is to maintain next to the view a list of "actions"
 * (I was using a hash storing the charpos of the token and associating
 * the action) but it is tedious too. Simpler to use mutable/ref. We
 * use the same idea that we use when working on the Ast.
 *
 * old: when I was using the list of "actions" next to the views, the hash
 * indexed by the charpos, there could have been some problems:
 * how my fake_pos interact with the way I tag and adjust token ?
 * because I base my tagging on the position of the token ! so sometimes
 * could tag another fakeInfo that should not be tagged ?
 * fortunately I don't use anymore this technique.
