(* history: we used to use /tmp files to parse Semgrep string patterns by
 * just dumping the pattern string first with Common.with_tmp_file and
 * then using the tmp file. Even though /tmp access is fast and often
 * cached in memory (e.g., by the Linux buffer cache), it is still
 * a bit ugly to use /tmp to parse strings and also a bit slower.
 * Enter input_source.

(* Many parsers need to interact with the lexer, or use tricks around
