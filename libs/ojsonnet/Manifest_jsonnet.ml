 * This file used to contain lots of code but after switching to
 * store explicit environment in Value_jsonnet.ml, the manifest_value()
 * function had to be mutually recursive with eval_expr() and so was
 * moved in Eval_jsonnet.ml
 * Still it's nice to hide this implememtation detail and still provide
 * a separate Manufest_jsonnet.ml file, even if it's just wrapping
 * Eval_jsonnet.manifest_value()
