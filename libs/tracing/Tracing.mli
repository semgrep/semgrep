(** Tracing library for Semgrep
 *
 * Provide a simple interface to send contextualized performance metrics
 * for Semgrep code using Opentelemetry traces. By default, they send to
 * our Datadog endpoint, but the collector can be customized using the
 * SEMGREP_OTEL_ENDPOINT environment variable.
 *
 * To trace a program, start by calling `configure_tracing`. Then, wrap
 * the entry point of the program (e.g. `Core_command.semgrep_core_dispatch`)
 * with `with_tracing`. Traces will now be sent for the duration of that
 * function.
 *
 * Running `with_tracing` always sends a trace for the wrapped function.
 * To trace other functions called within it, run those using `with_span`.
 * You can attach data to the traces by running `add_data_to_span`.

val configure_tracing : string -> Uri.t -> unit
(** [configure_tracing service_name tracing_endpoint] Before instrumenting
    anything, configure some settings. This should only be run once in a
    program, because it creates a backend with threads, HTTP connections, etc.
    when called. NOTE: this will set the active trace endpoint to whatever is
    passed. This endpoint will be used when restarting tracing via
    [restart_tracing] *)

val stop_tracing : unit -> unit
(** [stop_tracing ()] explicitly shuts down the Otel collector. If tracing has
    been setup this MUST be called before forking (such as in {!Parmap}), or you
    WILL experience random segfaults. This is safe to call multiple times in a
    row. See [restart_tracing] to continue tracing after calling this.

    Example:
    {[
      stop_tracing ();
      (if Unix.fork () = 0 then
      print_endline "child"
      else
      print_endline "parent");
      restart_tracing ();
    ]}
 *)

val restart_tracing : unit -> unit
(** [restart_tracing ()] will re-setup the Otel backend after [stop_tracing] is
    called to continue tracing. This is a no-op if [configure_tracing] has not
    been called. Will fail if called multiple times. See {!stop_tracing} for an
    example*)

val with_tracing :
  string -> (string * Trace_core.user_data) list -> (span -> 'a) -> 'a
(** [with_tracing span_name attributes f] Start tracing with a top level span
    named [span_name] that has attributes [attributes] and run [f]. Stops
    instrumenting once that function is finished. *)

val with_tracing_paused : (unit -> 'a) -> 'a
(** [with_tracing_paused f] will run [f] with tracing paused. This is usually
    called before forking, as Otel can segfault if it is not paused before
    forking. Essentially this calls [stop_tracing] and then
    [restart_tracing]. *)
