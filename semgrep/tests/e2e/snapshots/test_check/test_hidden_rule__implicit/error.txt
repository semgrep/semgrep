You need to specify a config with --config=<semgrep.dev config name|localfile|localdirectory|url>.
If you're looking for a config to start with, there are thousands at: https://semgrep.dev
The two most popular are:
    --config=p/ci # find logic bugs, and high-confidence security vulnerabilities; recommended for CI
    --config=p/security-audit # find security audit points; noisy, not recommended for CI
