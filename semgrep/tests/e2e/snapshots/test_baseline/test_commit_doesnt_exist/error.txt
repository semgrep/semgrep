Cannot find a commit with reference '12345'. Possible reasons:

- the referenced commit does not exist
- the git binary is not available
- the current working directory is not a git repository
- the current working directory is not marked as safe
    (fix with `git config --global --add safe.directory $(pwd)`)

Try running `git show 12345` to debug the issue.
