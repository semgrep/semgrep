    message: |
      Flask cookies should be handled securely by setting secure=True, httponly=True, and samesite='Lax' in  response.set_cookie(...). If your situation calls for different settings, explicitly disable the setting.
      If you want to send the cookie over http, set secure=False.  If you want to let client-side JavaScript
      read the cookie, set httponly=False. If you want to attach cookies to requests for external sites,
      set samesite=None.
