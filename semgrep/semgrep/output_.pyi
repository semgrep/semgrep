    Handle all output in a central location. Rather than calling `print_stderr` directly,
    you should call `handle_*` as appropriate.

    In normal usage, it should be constructed via the contextmanager, `managed_output`. It ensures that everything
    is handled properly if exceptions are thrown.

    If you need to stop execution immediately (think carefully if you really want this!), throw an exception.
    If this is normal behavior, the exception _must_ inherit from `SemgrepError`.

    If you want execution to continue, _report_ the exception via the appropriate `handle_*` method.
