[ERROR] Command failed with exit code: 128

Command failed with output:
fatal: Not a valid object name 12345


Failed to run 'git cat-file -e 12345'. Possible reasons:

- the git binary is not available
- the current working directory is not a git repository
- the baseline commit is not a parent of the current commit
    (if you are running through semgrep-app, check if you are setting `SEMGREP_BRANCH` or `SEMGREP_BASELINE_COMMIT` properly)
- the current working directory is not marked as safe
    (fix with `git config --global --add safe.directory $(pwd)`)

Try running the command yourself to debug the issue.
