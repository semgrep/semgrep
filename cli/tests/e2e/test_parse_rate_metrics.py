    # NOTE: for the syntax errors in the files below, changes in parsers may
    # change the exact error spans reported. The most likely scenarios for this
    # are:
    #   1. Changing a language from pfff -> tree-sitter. This may cause total
    #      parsing errors to become partial ones, as pfff doesn't report
    #      partial errors.
    #   2. Changing a tree-sitter grammar, either directly or from upstream.
    #      This might change the exact spans reported for partial parse errors.
    #   3. For language which go to a specific AST before the generic one, a
    #      change which causes an AST translation error to become a partial
    #      parsing error. Again, this would potentially cause total errors to
    #      become partial.
    # If you've made a change like the ones listed above, then updating the
    # snapshot (if it looks reasonable) should be fine.
