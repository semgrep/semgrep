        # TODO: regression because of

        # commented for now
        #
        # Let's say you have a pattern `func($X)` to match `func(bar)` where `bar`
        # comes from package `foo`. Semgrep-core returns two matches, in each match
        # the abstract_content of $X is different, in one it is `bar` and in the
        # other it is `foo.bar`. Right, but the token associated with both is now
        # the same since PR #6900, it's the token of `bar` for both matches! And
        # CLI ignores abstract_content and instead takes that token and reads the
        # content from the file, so for CLI both matches are exactly the same, they
        # set $X to `bar`. So it picks any one of them. However, join-mode does use
        # abstract_content, so the difference between the matches does matter. Then,
        # if join-mode tries to join rules R and S, and for rule R the CLI picked a
        # match with abstract_content equals to `foo.bar`, whereas for rule S the
        # CLI picked a match with abstract_content equals to `bar`... it won't work.
