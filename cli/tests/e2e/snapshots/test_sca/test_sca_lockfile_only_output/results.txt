          Versions of lodash prior to 4.17.19 are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution. The function
          zipObjectDeep allows a malicious user to modify the prototype of Object if the property identifiers
          are user-supplied. Being affected by this issue requires zipping objects based on user-provided
          property arrays.

          This vulnerability causes the addition or modification of an existing property that will exist on
          all objects and may lead to Denial of Service or Code Execution under specific circumstances.
