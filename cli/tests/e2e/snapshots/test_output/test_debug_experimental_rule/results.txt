Failed to get project url from 'git ls-remote': Command failed with exit code: 128
-----
Command failed with output:
fatal: No remote configured to list refs from.


Failed to run 'git ls-remote --get-url'. Possible reasons:

- the git binary is not available
- the current working directory is not a git repository
- the current working directory is not marked as safe
    (fix with `git config --global --add safe.directory $(pwd)`)

Try running the command yourself to debug the issue.
