[ERROR] Command failed with exit code: 128

Command failed with output:
fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git


Failed to run 'git cat-file -e 12345'. Possible reasons:

- the git binary is not available
- the current working directory is not a git repository
- the current working directory is not marked as safe
    (fix with `git config --global --add safe.directory $(pwd)`)

Try running the command yourself to debug the issue.
