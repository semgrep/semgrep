Usage: semgrep scan [OPTIONS] [TARGETS]...

  Run semgrep rules on files

  Searches TARGET paths for matches to rules or patterns. Defaults to searching
  entire current working directory.

  To get started quickly, run

      semgrep --config auto .

  This will automatically fetch rules for your project from the Semgrep
  Registry. NOTE: Using `--config auto` will log in to the Semgrep Registry with
  your project URL.

  For more information about Semgrep, go to https://semgrep.dev.

  NOTE: By default, Semgrep will report pseudonymous usage metrics to its server
  if you pull your configuration from the Semgrep registry. To learn more about
  how and why these metrics are collected, please see
  https://semgrep.dev/docs/metrics. To modify this behavior, see the --metrics
  option below.

Options:
  --replacement TEXT              An autofix expression that will be applied to
                                  any matches found with --pattern. Only valid
                                  with a command-line specified pattern.
  Configuration options: [mutually_exclusive]
    -c, -f, --config TEXT         YAML configuration file, directory of YAML
                                  files ending in .yml|.yaml, URL of a
                                  configuration file, or Semgrep registry entry
                                  name.
                                  
                                  Use --config auto to automatically obtain
                                  rules tailored to this project; your project
                                  URL will be used to log in  to the Semgrep
                                  registry.
                                  
                                  To run multiple rule files simultaneously, use
                                  --config before every YAML, URL, or Semgrep
                                  registry entry name.  For example `semgrep
                                  --config p/python --config
                                  myrules/myrule.yaml`
                                  
                                  See https://semgrep.dev/docs/writing-
                                  rules/rule-syntax for information on
                                  configuration file format.
    -e, --pattern TEXT            Code search pattern. See
                                  https://semgrep.dev/docs/writing-
                                  rules/pattern-syntax for information on
                                  pattern features.
  -l, --lang TEXT                 Parse pattern and all files in specified
                                  language. Must be used with -e/--pattern.
  --dryrun / --no-dryrun          If --dryrun, does not write autofixes to a
                                  file. This will print the changes to the
                                  console. This lets you see the changes before
                                  you commit to them. Only works with the
                                  --autofix flag. Otherwise does nothing.
  --severity [INFO|WARNING|ERROR]
                                  Report findings only from rules matching the
                                  supplied severity level. By default all
                                  applicable rules are run. Can add multiple
                                  times. Each should be one of INFO, WARNING, or
                                  ERROR.
  --show-supported-languages      Print a list of languages that are currently
                                  supported by Semgrep.
  Alternate modes:                No search is performed in these modes
    --validate                    Validate configuration file(s). This will
                                  check YAML files for errors and run
                                  'p/semgrep-rule-lints' on the YAML files. No
                                  search is performed.
    --version                     Show the version and exit.
  Test and debug options: 
    --test                        Run test suite.
    --test-ignore-todo / --no-test-ignore-todo
                                  If --test-ignore-todo, ignores rules marked as
                                  '#todoruleid:' in test files.
    --dump-ast / --no-dump-ast    If --dump-ast, shows AST of the input file or
                                  passed expression and then exit (can use
                                  --json).
  --error / --no-error            Exit 1 if there are findings. Useful for CI
                                  and scripts.
  --strict / --no-strict          Return a nonzero exit code when WARN level
                                  errors are encountered. Fails early if invalid
                                  configuration files are present. Defaults to
                                  --no-strict.
  -h, --help                      Show this message and exit.
  -a, --autofix / --no-autofix    Apply autofix patches. WARNING: data loss can
                                  occur with this flag. Make sure your files are
                                  stored in a version control system. Note that
                                  this mode is experimental and not guaranteed
                                  to function properly.
  --baseline-commit TEXT          Only show results that are not found in this
                                  commit hash. Aborts run if not currently in a
                                  git directory, there are unstaged changes, or
                                  given baseline hash doesn't exist
  --metrics [auto|on|off]         Configures how usage metrics are sent to the
                                  Semgrep server. If 'auto', metrics are sent
                                  whenever the --config value pulls from the
                                  Semgrep server. If 'on', metrics are always
                                  sent. If 'off', metrics are disabled
                                  altogether and not sent. If absent, the
                                  SEMGREP_SEND_METRICS environment variable
                                  value will be used. If no environment
                                  variable, defaults to 'auto'.
  Path options:                   By default, Semgrep scans all git-tracked
                                  files with extensions matching rules'
                                  languages. These options alter which files
                                  Semgrep scans.
    --exclude TEXT                Skip any file or directory that matches this
                                  pattern; --exclude='*.py' will ignore the
                                  following: foo.py, src/foo.py, foo.py/bar.sh.
                                  --exclude='tests' will ignore tests/foo.py as
                                  well as a/b/tests/c/foo.py. Can add multiple
                                  times. If present, any --include directives
                                  are ignored.
    --exclude-rule TEXT           Skip any rule with the given id. Can add
                                  multiple times.
    --include TEXT                Filter files or directories by path. The
                                  argument is a glob-style pattern such as
                                  'foo.*' that must match the path. This is an
                                  extra filter in addition to other applicable
                                  filters. For example, specifying the language
                                  with '-l javascript' might preselect files
                                  'src/foo.jsx' and 'lib/bar.js'. Specifying one
                                  of '--include=src', '--include=*.jsx', or '--
                                  include=src/foo.*' will restrict the selection
                                  to the single file 'src/foo.jsx'. A choice of
                                  multiple '--include' patterns can be
                                  specified. For example, '--include=foo.*
                                  --include=bar.*' will select both
                                  'src/foo.jsx' and 'lib/bar.js'. Glob-style
                                  patterns follow the syntax supported by
                                  python, which is documented at
                                  https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html
    --max-target-bytes BYTES      Maximum size for a file to be scanned by
                                  Semgrep, e.g '1.5MB'. Any input program larger
                                  than this will be ignored. A zero or negative
                                  value disables this filter. Defaults to
                                  1000000 bytes.
    --use-git-ignore / --no-git-ignore
                                  Skip files ignored by git. Scanning starts
                                  from the root folder specified on the Semgrep
                                  command line. Normally, if the scanning root
                                  is within a git repository, only the tracked
                                  files and the new files would be scanned. Git
                                  submodules and git-ignored files would
                                  normally be skipped. --no-git-ignore will
                                  disable git-aware filtering. Setting this flag
                                  does nothing if the scanning root is not in a
                                  git repository.
    --scan-unknown-extensions / --skip-unknown-extensions
                                  If true, explicit files will be scanned using
                                  the language specified in --lang. If --skip-
                                  unknown-extensions, these files will not be
                                  scanned. Defaults to false.
  Performance and memory options: 
    --enable-version-check / --disable-version-check
                                  Checks Semgrep servers to see if the latest
                                  version is run; disabling this may reduce exit
                                  time after returning results.
    -j, --jobs INTEGER            Number of subprocesses to use to run checks in
                                  parallel. Defaults to the number of cores on
                                  the system (1 if using --pro).
    --max-memory INTEGER          Maximum system memory to use running a rule on
                                  a single file in MiB. If set to 0 will not
                                  have memory limit. Defaults to 0 for all CLI
                                  scans. For CI scans that use the pro engine,
                                  it defaults to 5000 MiB
    --optimizations [all|none]    Turn on/off optimizations. Default = 'all'.
                                  Use 'none' to turn all optimizations off.
    --timeout INTEGER             Maximum time to spend running a rule on a
                                  single file in seconds. If set to 0 will not
                                  have time limit. Defaults to 30 s.
    --timeout-threshold INTEGER   Maximum number of rules that can timeout on a
                                  file before the file is skipped. If set to 0
                                  will not have limit. Defaults to 3.
    --interfile-timeout INTEGER   Maximum time to spend on interfile analysis.
                                  If set to 0 will not have time limit. Defaults
                                  to 0 s for all CLI scans. For CI scans, it
                                  defaults to 3 hours.
  Display options: 
    --enable-nosem / --disable-nosem
                                  --enable-nosem enables 'nosem'. Findings will
                                  not be reported on lines containing a 'nosem'
                                  comment at the end. Enabled by default.
    --force-color / --no-force-color
                                  Always include ANSI color in the output, even
                                  if not writing to a TTY; defaults to using the
                                  TTY status
    --max-chars-per-line INTEGER  Maximum number of characters to show per line.
    --max-lines-per-finding INTEGER
                                  Maximum number of lines of code that will be
                                  shown for each match before trimming (set to 0
                                  for unlimited).
    --dataflow-traces             Explain how non-local values reach the
                                  location of a finding (only affects text and
                                  SARIF output).
    -o, --output TEXT             Save search results to a file or post to URL.
                                  Default is to print to stdout.
    --rewrite-rule-ids / --no-rewrite-rule-ids
                                  Rewrite rule ids when they appear in nested
                                  sub-directories (Rule 'foo' in test/rules.yaml
                                  will be renamed 'test.foo').
    --time / --no-time            Include a timing summary with the results. If
                                  output format is json, provides times for each
                                  pair (rule, target).
  Verbosity options: [mutually_exclusive]
    -q, --quiet                   Only output findings.
    -v, --verbose                 Show more details about what rules are
                                  running, which files failed to parse, etc.
    --debug                       All of --verbose, but with additional
                                  debugging information.
  Output formats: [mutually_exclusive]
                                  Uses ASCII output if no format specified.
    --text                        Output results in Emacs single-line format.
