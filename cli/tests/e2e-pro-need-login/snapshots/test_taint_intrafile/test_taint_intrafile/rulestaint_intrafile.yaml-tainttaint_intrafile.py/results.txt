            2┆ sink(x)


          Taint comes from:

            5┆ y = "taint"


          Taint flows through these intermediate variables:

            5┆ y = "taint"


                This is how taint reaches the sink:

            6┆ foo(y)

          Taint flows through these intermediate variables:

            1┆ def foo(x):

          then reaches:

            2┆ sink(x)
