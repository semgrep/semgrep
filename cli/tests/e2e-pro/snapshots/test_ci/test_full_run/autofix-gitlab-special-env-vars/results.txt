[ERROR] Error while running rules:
                    You are seeing this because the engine was killed.

                    The most common reason this happens is because it used too much memory.
                    If your repo is large (~10k files or more), you have three options:
                    1. Increase the amount of memory available to semgrep
                    2. Reduce the number of jobs semgrep runs with via `-j <jobs>`. We
                        recommend using 1 job if you are running out of memory.
                    3. Scan the repo in parts (contact us for help)

                    Otherwise, it is likely that semgrep is hitting the limit on only some
                    files. In this case, you can try to set the limit on the amount of memory
                    semgrep can use on each file with `--max-memory <memory>`. We recommend
                    lowering this to a limit 70% of the available memory. For CI runs with
                    interfile analysis, the default max-memory is 5000MB. Without, the default
                    is unlimited.

                    The last thing you can try if none of these work is to raise the stack
                    limit with `ulimit -s <limit>`.

                    If you have tried all these steps and still are seeing this error, please
                    contact us.
