# pipenv does not support multiple python versions, but the
# dependencies of jsonschema differ from < 3.8 to >= 3.8. Therefore we just
# rely on these directly for the dev environment so that an entry for these is
# always generated for the lockfile, regardless of the local version of python.
# If we change to Poetry or another system which allows multiple version of
# python these could likely be removed.
