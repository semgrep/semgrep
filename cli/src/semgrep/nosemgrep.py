"""
Handles ignoring Semgrep findings via inline code comments

Currently supports ignoring a finding on a single line by adding a
`# nosemgrep:ruleid` comment (or `// nosemgrep:ruleid`).

To use, create a RuleMatchMap, then pass it to process_ignores().

Coupling: semgrep-action uses a regexp to strip nosemgrep comments so as
to normalize the code and not be sensitive to the addition or removal
of nosemgrep comments.
See https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep-action/blob/develop/src/semgrep_agent/findings.py
and check that it's compatible with any change we're making here.
