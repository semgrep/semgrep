#
# This uses an RPC mechanism to call out to `semgrep-core` separately from the
# main call to `semgrep-core`. In https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep/pull/9229,
# Brandon initially attempted to move autofix application into the main call to
# `semgrep-core`. However, logic implemented in Python after that call relies on
# the repository being in its original state. For example, we run a baseline
# scan after the initial call to `semgrep-core`, which requires the repository
# to be in a clean state. Therefore, we cannot currently absorb this
# functionality into the main `semgrep-core` call.

    #    that by returning the number of modified files from OCaml and printing
    #    it here.
    # 2. We would like to mutate the matches to add a `fixed_lines` property. To
    #    do that, we make a list of (rulematch, edit) pairs. We pass the edits
    #    to OCaml. Then we get a list of fixed_lines along with an index for the
    #    associated match. We use that index to mutate the appropriate fix.
