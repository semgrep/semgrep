#
# A container with semgrep in it, made to work from within the container.
# - changes the entrypoint to bash
# - installs some basic packages
#
# This is used for running semgrep benchmarks and other CI jobs without having
# to rebuild semgrep from scratch.
#

# Version of semgrep built each time the main ('develop') branch is updated.
# It's built from the main Dockerfile (semgrep.Dockerfile) in the semgrep repo.
#
# For things like benchmarks, we want a "recent version of semgrep that works".
#
FROM returntocorp/semgrep:develop

# Various utilities. We can always install them during the CI job but it's
# it's nice to do it here while we're root.
