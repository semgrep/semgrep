This is an experimental project to compile Semgrep to Javascript
using js_of_ocaml to compile the OCaml code, and emscripten and WASM to
compile the C code generated by tree-sitter and libyaml.

After running:

```
$ source libs/ocaml-tree-sitter-core/tree-sitter-config.sh
$ make core
$ dune build --profile=release
```

you should get a big Javascript file in \_build/default/js/engine/engine.js

Building with `dune build --profile=release` (instead of the default --profile=dev)
has a significant impact on the size of the generated JS file. You can go
from 110MB to 16MB!
See https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/tutorial-full-stack-web-dev-in-ocaml-w-dream-bonsai-and-graphql/9963/8?u=aryx for more information

You can then load this file in your browser and test it [here](examples/index.html).

You can also load this file in nodejs and test it with:

```bash
js % node
