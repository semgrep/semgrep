This is an experimental project to compile semgrep-core to Javascript
using js_of_ocaml to compile the OCaml code, and emscripten and WASM to
compile the C code generated by tree-sitter.

After:

```
$ source libs/ocaml-tree-sitter-core/tree-sitter-config.sh
$ make core
$ dune build --profile=release
```

you should get a big Javascript file in \_build/default/js/engine/semgrep-core.js

Building with `dune build --profile=release` (instead of the default --profile=dev)
has a significant impact on the size of the generated JS file. You can go
from 110MB to 16MB!
