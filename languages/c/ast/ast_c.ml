(* A (real) Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for C, not a Concrete Syntax Tree (CST)
 * as in cst_cpp.ml.
 *
 * This file contains a simplified AST for C. The original
 * C/C++ syntax tree (cst_cpp.ml) is good for code refactoring or
 * code visualization; the types used match exactly the source. However,
 * for other algorithms, the nature of the CST makes the code a bit
 * redundant. Moreover many analysis are far simpler to write on
 * C than C++. Hence the idea of a simple AST which is the
 * original CST where certain constructions have been factorized
 * or even removed.

 * Here is a list of the simplications/factorizations:
 *  - no C++ constructs, just plain C
 *  - no purely syntactical tokens in the AST like parenthesis, brackets,
 *    braces, commas, semicolons, etc. No ParenExpr. No FinalDef. No
 *    NotParsedCorrectly. The only token information kept is for identifiers
 *    for error reporting. See name below.
 *    update: actually we keep more tokens now because of semgrep.
 *  - Few cpp constructs and no ifdefs (they are skipped, and just
 *    one branch is converted to ast_c)
 *  - ...
 *  - no nested struct, they are lifted to the toplevel
 *  - no anonymous structure (an artificial name is gensym'ed)
 *  - no mix of typedef with decl
 *  - sugar is removed, no RecordAccess vs RecordPtAccess, ...
 *  - no init vs expr
 *  - no Case/Default in statement but instead a focused 'case' type
 *
 * less: ast_c_simple_build.ml is probably incomplete, but for now
 * good enough for codegraph purposes on xv6, plan9 and other small C
 * projects.
 *
 * related work:
 *  - CIL, but it works after preprocessing; it makes it harder to connect
 *    analysis results to tools like codemap. It also does not handle some of
 *    the kencc extensions and does not allow to analyze cpp constructs.
 *    CIL has two pointer analysis but they were written with bug finding
 *    in mind I think, not code comprehension which we really care about
 *    in pfff.
 *    In the end I thought generating datalog facts for plan9 using lang_c/
 *    was simpler that modifying CIL (moreover fixing lang_cpp/ and lang_c/
 *    to handle plan9 code was anyway needed for codemap).
 *  - SIL's monoidics. SIL looks a bit complicated, but it might be a good
 *    candidate, unforunately their API are not easily accessible in
 *    a findlib library form yet.
 *  - Clang, but like CIL it works after preprocessing, does not handle kencc,
 *    and does not provide by default a convenient ocaml AST. I could use
 *    clang-ocaml though but it's not easily accessible in a findlib
 *    library form yet.
 *  - we could also use the AST used by cc in plan9 :)
 *
 * See also lang_cpp/parsing/cst_cpp.ml.
