* Conflicts in Java 1.0

A great prelimiary writeup to read on conflicts is the official
LALR grammar comments in the 1st edition of the Java specification, which is
still accessible at https://www.cs.cornell.edu/andru/javaspec/19.doc.html
(also cached in docs/official-grammars/java/).

** Different names for different entities
See the writeup above pb #1.
Led to just having a general Name non terminal.

** Different modifiers for different entities
See the writeup above pb #2.
Led to just having a general Modifiers non terminal.

** Field declaration vs method declaration
See the writeup above pb #3.
Led to inline ResultType in MethodHeader.

** Array type vs array access.
See the writeup above pb #4.
Led to inline Type def in ArrayType.

** Cast vs parenthesized expression
See the writeup above pb #5.
Led to generalize CastExpression and inline some of ReferenceType.

* modifiers vs modifiers_opt

In many places we can not use modifiers_opt (or one of its variant
like variable_modifiers_opt) but have instead to inline its content
and create in the parent 2 alternatives like

ruleA:
|  modifiers XXX { }
|            XXX { }

This is usually when XXX can be a type or an identifier.
Seeing an identifier, which can be start of a type, yacc does not know
if it can reduce modifiers_opt. It needs to read more than the next
ident to know if this is the start of a declaration with a modifier and a type
or a simple identifier.

ex: lambda_param.

update: %inline in menhir can help!

* Cast vs unary_expr_not_plus_or_minus

When have read '(foo)' and see a '+',
if the cast_expression rule was written as:

cast_expression:
 | LP expression RP unary_expression

then because of also this rule:

primary_no_new_array:
 | LP expression RP    { $2 }

they is no way to disambiguate between   a possible (foo) + 2 addition
and the cast  (foo) of the +2 unary expr.

This is why the java grammar uses

cast_expression:
 | LP expression RP unary_expression_not_plus_minus

* When add generics

We can have expressions like:
 i<b;
and type declarations like
 i<b> x;

hence an ambiguity which requires some lookahead or semantic information
to know what is 'i' (is it a type name?).

solutions?
 - (1) use a GLR parser
 - (2) c/c++ parser trick to tag differently <
 - (3) parser trick to tag differently typedef and idents

I currently use #3.

* when add generic methods

* Lambda

See the same notes on this subject in lang_php/parsing/conflicts.txt
and lang_js/parsing/conflicts.txt

* Lambda and Cast

lambda_expression are at the very top in the grammar expr rules,
so they can not appear anywhere unless put inside parenthesis. See:

expression:
 | assignment_expression  { $1 }
 /*(* javaext: ? *)*/
 | lambda_expression { $1 }

For example this is not allowed 'a -> 1 + a -> 2'
because after 1 +, you can only have a multiplicative_expr, then
 unary_expr, then postfix_expr then primary, which imposes
 a LP expression RP.

This breaks when lambda_expressions were allowed in
cast_expression, which are very low in the java grammar, with originally:

cast_expression:
 ...
 | LP expression RP lambda_expression

In that case however, if you read '(foo) a -> 1 ' and then
you look a '+2', there is no way to know if it should be parsed as
(foo) a -> 1+2, or (foo) a -> 1     +   2
because a cast_expression can be part of a multiplicative, or addivitive
expression.

To solve the ambiguity you need to forbid cast of lambda inside
cast_expression, and instead allow it only at the top with

expression:
 | assignment_expression  { $1 }
 | lambda_expression { $1 }
 | lambda_cast_expression { }

and
lambda_cast_expression: LP expression RP lambda_expression
