(* Prelude *)
(*****************************************************************************)
(*
 * This module transforms certain tokens like '>>', normally a T_SR
 * into two TGREATER tokens which helps avoid using ugly tricks in the grammar
 * regarding generics.
 *
 * This is similar to what we do for C/C++.
 * See cpp/.../parsing_hacks.ml for more information.
 *
 * In Hack they maintain those different states (InToplevel, InFunction,
 * InBlock, ...) in the lexer itself, I prefer for now to separate
 * concerns and do that entirely post-lexing (which introduces some performance
 * degradation, from 195s to parse www to 209s).
