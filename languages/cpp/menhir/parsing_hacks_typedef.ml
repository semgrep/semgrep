(* Prelude *)
(*****************************************************************************)
(* This file gathers parsing heuristics related to typedefs.
 *
 * C does not have a context-free grammar; C requires the parser to know when
 * an ident corresponds to a typedef or an ident. This normally means that
 * we must call cpp on the file and have the lexer and parser cooperate
 * to remember what is what. In lang_cpp/ we want to parse as-is,
 * which means we need to infer back whether an identifier is
 * a typedef or not.
 *
 * In this module we use a view that is more convenient for
 * typedefs detection. We got rid of:
 *  - template arguments (see find_template_commentize())
 *  - qualifiers (see find_qualifier_commentize)
 *  - differences between & and * (filter_for_typedef() below)
 *  - differences between TIdent and TOperator,
 *  - const, volatile, restrict keywords
 *  - TODO merge multiple ** or *& or whatever
 *
 * history:
 *  - We used to make the lexer and parser cooperate in a lexerParser.ml file.
 *    However, this was not enough because of declarations such as 'acpi acpi;'
 *    and so we had to enable/disable the ident->typedef mechanism
 *    which requires even more lexer/parser cooperation
 *  - This forced-cooperation was ugly so we switched to
 *    a typedef "inference" mechanism
 *  - we refined the typedef inference to sometimes use InParameter hint
 *    and more contextual information from token_views_context.ml
