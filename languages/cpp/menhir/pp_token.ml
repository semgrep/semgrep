(*
 * CPP functions working at the token level. See pp_ast.ml for cpp functions
 * working at the AST level (which is very unusual but makes sense in
 * the coccinelle context for instance).
 *
 * Note that because I use a single lexer to work both at the C and cpp level
 * there are some inconveniencies.
 * For instance 'for' is a valid name for a macro parameter and macro
 * body, but is interpreted in a special way by our single lexer, and
 * so at some places where I expect a TIdent I need also to
 * handle special cases and accept Tfor, Tif, etc at those places.
 *
 * There are multiple issues related to those keywords incorrect tokens.
 * Those keywords can be:
 *
 *   - (1) in the name of the macro as  in  #define inline
 *   - (2) in a parameter of the macro as in #define foo(char)   char x;
 *   - (3) in an argument to a macro call as in   IDENT(if);
 *
 * Case 1 is easy to fix in define_ident in ???
 *
 * Case 2 is easy to fix in define_parse below, where we detect such tokens
 * in the parameters and then replace their occurence in the body with
 * a TIdent.
 *
 * Case 3 is only an issue when the expanded token is not really used
 * as usual but used for instance in concatenation as in  a ## if
 * when expanded. In the case the grammar this time will not be happy
 * so this is also easy to fix in cpp_engine.
