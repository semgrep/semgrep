## [1.34.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v1.34.0) - 2023-07-27

### Added

- Added support for naming propagation when the left-hand side (lhs) of a variable definition is an identifier pattern

  In certain languages like Rust, the variable definition is parsed as a pattern assignment, for example:

  ```
  let x: SomeType = SomeFunction();
  ```

  This commit ensures that the annotated type is propagated to the identifier pattern on the left-hand side (lhs) of the assignment, thus ensuring proper naming behavior. (gh-8365)

- feat(metavar type): Metavariable type support for Julia

  Metavariable type is supported for Julia. (gh-8367)

- New --legacy flag to force the use of the old Python implementation of
  Semgrep (also known as 'pysemgrep'). Note that by default most semgrep
  commands are still using the Python implementation (except 'semgrep
  interactive'), so in practice you don't need to add this flag, but as
  we port more commands to OCaml, the new --legacy flag might be useful
  if you find some regressions. (legacy)
- Matching: Added the ability to use metavariables in parameters to match more
  sophisticated kinds of parameters.

  In particular, metavariables should now be able to match `self` parameters,
  such as in Rust.

  So `fn $F($X, ...) { ... }` should match `fn $F(self) { }`. (pa-2937)

- taint-mode: Added **experimental** `control: true` option to `pattern-sources`,
  e.g.:

  ```yaml
  pattern-sources:
    - control: true
      pattern: source(...)
  ```

  Such sources taint the "control flow" (or the program counter) so that it is
  possible to implement reachability queries that do not require the flow of any
  data. Thus, Semgrep reports a finding in the code below, because after `source()`
  the flow of control will reach `sink()`, even if no data is flowing between both:

  ````python
  def test():
    source()
    foo()
    bar()
    #ruleid: test
    sink()
  ``` (pa-2958)
  ````

- taint-mode: Taint sanitizers will be included in matching explanations. (pa-2975)

### Changed

- Started using ATD to define the schema for data sent to the /complete endpoint of semgrep app (app-4255)
- Targets in a `.yarn/` directory are now ignored by the default .semgrepignore patterns. (dotyarn)

### Fixed

- Aliengrep mode: Fix whitespace bug preventing correct matching of parentheses. (gh-7990)
- yaml: exclude style markers from matched token in block scalars (gh-8348)
- Fixed stack overflow caused by symbolic propagation. (pa-2933)
- Rust: Macro calls which involve dereferencing and reference operators
  (such as `foo!(&x)` and `foo!(*x)`) now properly transmit taint (pa-2951)
- Semgrep no longer crashes when running --test (pa-2963)
- Exceptions raised during parsing of manifest files no longer interrupt general parser execution, which previously prevented lockfile parsing if a manifest failed to parse. (sc-exceptions)

## [1.33.2](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v1.33.2) - 2023-07-21

No significant changes.

## [1.33.1](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v1.33.1) - 2023-07-21

### Added

- Rust: Added support for ellipsis patterns in attribute argument position. (e.g. `#[get(...)]`) (gh-8234)
- Promql: Initial language support (gh-8281)
- `.h` files will now run when C or C++ are selected as the language. (pa-123)
- `.cjs` and `.mjs` files will now run when javascript is selected as the language. (pa-124)
- Tainting: Parameters to functions in languages with pattern matching in function
  arguments, such as Rust and OCaml, now transmit taint when they are sources.
  This works with nested patterns too. For instance, in Rust:
  ```
  fn f ((x, (y, z)): t) {
    let x = 2;
  }
  ```
  tainting the sole argument to this function will result in all of the identifiers
  `x`, `y`, and `z` now being tainted. (pa-2919)
- Added rule option `interfile: true`, so this can be set under `options:` as it
  is the norm for rule options. This rule option shall replace setting `interfile`
  under `metadata`. Metadata is not mean to have any effect on how a rule is run. (pro-94)

### Changed

- Updated semgrep-interfaces, changed `api_scans_findings` to `ci_scan_results`, removed `gitlab_token` field and added `ignores` and `renamed_paths` field to `ci_scan_results`. (app-4252)

### Fixed

- Dockerfile language support: String matching is now done by contents, treating
  the strings `foo`, `'foo'`, or `"foo"` as equal. (gh-8229)
- Fixed error where we were not filtering the logging of a new third party library. (gh-8310)
- Julia: Fixed a bug where try-catch patterns would not match properly.
  Now, you can use an empty try-catch pattern, such as:

  ```
  try
    ...
  catch
    ...
  end
  ```

  to catch _only_ Julia code which does not specify an identifier for the `catch`.

  Otherwise, if you want to match any kind of try-catch, you can specify an ellipsis
  for the catch identifier instead:

  ```
  try
    ...
  catch ...
    ...
  end
  ```

  and this will match any try-catch, including those that do not specify an
  identifier for the `catch`. It is strictly more general than the previous. (pa-2918)

- Rust: Fixed an issue where implicit returns did not allow taint to flow,
  and various other small translation issues that would affect taint. (pa-2936)
- Fixed bug in gradle.lockfile parser where we would error on `empty=` with nothing after it (sc-987)

## [1.32.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v1.32.0) - 2023-07-13

### Added

- feat(docker): Create a semgrep user for our docker container so that people can run it as a non-root user (gh-8116)
- feat(typed metavar): Typed metavariable support for Rust

  Users can create `TypedMetavar` using Rust's type annotation syntax `:`.
  For example, the following rule works for matching `HttpResponseBuilder`
  type of variables:

  ````
  rules:
  - id: no-direct-response-write
    patterns:
    - pattern: '($BUILDER : HttpResponseBuilder).body(...)'
    - pattern-not: '($BUILDER : HttpResponseBuilder).body("...".to_string())'
    message: find dangerous codes
    severity: WARNING
    languages: [rust]
  ``` (gh-8200)
  ````

### Fixed

- baseline scans reporting on existing findings (baseline-supply-chain)
- Fixed an issue leading to incorrect autofix results involving JS/TS async arrow functions (e.g. `async () => {}`, etc.). (gh-7353)
- Workaround for rootless containers as git operations may fail due to dubious ownership of /src (gh-8267)

## [1.31.2](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v1.31.2) - 2023-07-07

No significant changes.

## [1.31.1](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v1.31.1) - 2023-07-07

No significant changes.

## [1.31.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v1.31.0) - 2023-07-07

### Added

- Make CLI hit the new endpoint for the reliable fixed status on the Semgrep app. (cod-16)
- feat(rule syntax): Metavariable Type Extension for Semgrep Rule Syntax 2.0

  This PR introduces the changes made in Semgrep rule syntax 1.0 to version 2.0 as well.

  # rule syntax 2.0

  rules:

  - id: no-string-eqeq
    message: find errors
    severity: WARNING
    languages:
    - java
      match:
      all: - not: null == (String $Y) - $X == (String $Y)

  # rule syntax 2.0 after proposed change

  rules:

  - id: no-string-eqeq
    message: find errors
    severity: WARNING
    languages:
    - java
      match:
      all: - not: null == $Y - $X == $Y
      where: - metavariable: $Y
      type: String (gh-8183)

- Rust: Added the ability to taint macro calls through its arguments, in macro calls
  with multiple arguments. (pa-2902)
- Add severity and suggested upgrade versions to Supply Chain findings (sc-772)
- Added support for pnpm lockfile versions >= 6.0 (sc-824)
- (sc-866)

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue leading to incorrect autofix results involving JS/TS arrow functions (e.g. `() => {}`). (gh-7353)
- Dockerfile support: single-quoted strings are now parsed without an error. (gh-7780)
- Fixes Go issue with patterns like make(...); make(...,$X); make($A,$B). (gh-8171)
- Fixed rust attribute patterns to allow matching on simple attribute syntax. (pa-2903)
- Rust: Fixed a bug where standalone metavariable patterns
  were not matching as expected (pa-2915)
- Fixed python semgrep pattern parsing to also parse match statements, by chaining in the python tree-sitter parser, and adding metavariable support to the python tree-sitter parser. (pa-6442)
- poetry.lock parsing: handle empty toml tables, quoted table keys, and arbitrarily placed comments (sc-834)

## [1.30.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v1.30.0) - 2023-06-28

### Added

- feat(rule syntax): Support metavariable-type field for Kotlin, Go, Scala

  `metavariable-type` field is now supported for Kotlin, Go and Scala. (gh-8147)

- feat(rule syntax): Support metavariable-type field for csharp, typescript, php, rust

  `metavariable-type` field is now supported for csharp, typescript, php, rust. (gh-8164)

- Pattern syntax: You may now introduce metavariables from parts of regular
  expressions using `pattern-regex`, by using regular expression with
  named capturing groups (see https://www.regular-expressions.info/named.html)

  Now, such capture group metavariables must be explicitly named.
  So for instance, the pattern:

  ```
  pattern-regex: "foo-(?P<X>.*)"
  ```

  binds what is matched by the capture group to the metavariable `$X`,
  which can be used as normal.

  `pattern-regex` patterns with capture groups, such
  as

  ```
  pattern-regex: "(.*)"
  ```

  will still introduce metavariables of the form `$1`, `$2`, etc, but this
  should be considered deprecated behavior, and that functionality will be
  taken away in a future release. Named capturing groups should be primarily
  used, instead. (pa-2765)

- Rule syntax: Errors during rule parsing are now better. For instance,
  parsing will now complain if you miss a hyphen in a list of patterns,
  or if you try to give a string to `patterns` or `pattern-either`. (pa-2877)
- JS/TS: Now, patterns of records with ellipses, like:
  ```
  { $X: ... }
  ```
  properly match to records of anonymous functions, like:
  ````
  {
    func: () => { return 1; }
  }
  ``` (pa-2878)
  ````

### Changed

- engine: Removed matching cache optimization which had been previously disabled by
  default in 1.22.0 (we got no reports of any performance regression during this time). (cleanup-1)

### Fixed

- Language server no longer crashes when a user is logged in and opens a non git repo folder (pa-2886)
- It is not required anymore to have semgrep (and pysemgrep) in the PATH. (pa-2895)

## [1.29.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v1.29.0) - 2023-06-26

### Added

- feat(rule syntax): Metavariable Type Extension for Semgrep Rule Syntax

  We've added a dedicated field for annotating the type information of
  metavariables. By adopting this approach, instead of relying solely on
  language-specific casting syntax, we provide an additional way to enhance
  the overall usability by eliminating the need to write redundant type cast
  expressions for a single metavariable.

  Moreover, the new syntax brings other benefits, including improved support for
  target languages that lack built-in casting syntax. It also promotes a unified
  approach to expressing type, pattern, and regex constraints for metavariables,
  resulting in improved consistency across rule definitions.

  Current syntax:

  ```
  rules:
    - id: no-string-eqeq
      severity: WARNING
      message: find errors
      languages:
        - java
      patterns:
        - pattern-not: null == (String $Y)
        - pattern: $X == (String $Y)
  ```

  Added syntax:

  ````
  rules:
    - id: no-string-eqeq
      severity: WARNING
      message: find errors
      languages:
        - java
      patterns:
        - pattern-not: null == $Y
        - pattern: $X == $Y
        - metavariable-type:
            metavariable: $Y
            type: String
  ``` (gh-8119)
  ````

- feat(rule syntax): Support metavariable-type field for Python

  `metavariable-type` field is now supported for Python too. (gh-8126)

- New --experimental flag to switch to a new implementation of Semgrep entirely
  written in OCaml with faster startup time, incremental display of matches,
  AST and registry caching, a new interactive mode and more. Not all
  features of the legacy Python Semgrep have been ported though. (osemgrep)
- Matching: Writing a pattern which is a sequence of statements, such as
  ```
  foo();
  ...
  bar();
  ```
  now allows matching to sequences of statements within objects, classes,
  and related language constructs, in all languages. (pa-2754)

### Changed

- taint-mode: Several improvements to `taint_assume_safe_{booleans,numbers}` options.
  Most notably, we will now use type info provided by explicit type casts, and we will
  also use const-prop info to infer types. (pa-2777)

### Fixed

- Added support for post-pip0614 decorators; now semgrep accepts decorators of
  the form `@ named_expr_test NEWLINE`, so for example with the pattern
  `lambda $X:$X($X)`:

  ````python
  #match 1
  @omega := lambda ha:ha(ha)
  def func():
    return None

  #match 2
  @omega[lambda a:a(a)].a.b.c.f("wahoo")
  def fun():
    return None
  ``` (gh-4946)
  ````

- Fixed a typing issue with go; where semgrep with the pattern
  '($VAR : *tau.rho).$F()` wouldn't produce a match in the
  following:

  ```go
  func f() {
    i_1 := &tau.rho{}
    i_2 := new(tau.rho)

    i_1.shift() //miss one
    i_2.left()  //miss two

    return 101
  }
  ```

  but now we don't miss those two findings! (gh-6733)

- Constant propagation is now applied to stack array declarations in C; so
  a pattern `$TYPE $NAME[101];` will now produce two matches in the following snippet:

  ````c
  int main() {

    int bad_len = 101;
    /* match 1 */
    int arr1[101];
    /* match 2 */
    int arr2[bad_len];
    return 0;
  }
  ``` (gh-8037)
  ````

- Solidity: allow metavariables for version, as in `pragma solidity >= $VER;` (gh-8104)
- Added support for parsing patterns of the form
  ```
  #[Attr1]
  #[Attr2]
  ```
  In code such as
  ```
  #[Attr1]
  #[Attr2]
  function test ()
  {
      echo "Test";
  }
  ```
  Previously, to match against multiple attributes it was required to write
  ````
  #[Attr1, Attr2]
  ``` (pa-7398)
  ````

## [1.28.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v1.28.0) - 2023-06-21

### Added

- Added lone decorators as a valid Python semgrep pattern, so for example `$NAME($X)` will
  generate two seperate findings here:
  ````
  @hello("world")
  @hi("semgrep!")
  def shift():
    return "left!"
  ``` (gh-4722)
  ````
- Add tags to the python wheel for 3.10 and 3.11 (gh-8040)
- JS/TS: Patterns for class properties can now have the `static`
  and `async` modifiers.

  For instance:

  ```
  @Foo(...)
  async bar(...) {
    ...
  }
  ```

  or

  ````
  @Foo(...)
  static bar(...) {
    ...
  }
  ``` (pa-2675)
  ````

- Semgrep Language Server now supports multi-folder workspaces (pa-2772)
- New pre-commit hook `semgrep-ci` to use CI rules in pre-commit, which will pull from the rule board + block those in the block column (pa-2795)
- Added support for date comparison and functionality to get current date.
  Currently this requires date strings to be in the format "yyyy-mm-dd" next step is to support other formats. (pa-7992)

### Changed

- The output of `--debug` will be much less verbose by default, it will only show
  internal warning and error messages. (debug-1)
- Updated the maximum number of cores autodetected to 16 to prevent overloading on large machines when users do not specify number of jobs themselves (pa-2807)

### Fixed

- taint analysis: Improve handling of dataflow for tainted value propagation in class field definitions

  This change resolves an issue where dataflow was not correctly accounted for
  when tainted values flowed through field definitions in class/object
  definitions. For instance, in Kotlin or Scala, singleton objects are commonly
  used to encapsulate executable logic, where each field definition behaves like
  a statement during object initialization. In order to handle this scenario, we
  have introduced an additional step to analyze a sequence of field definitions
  as a sequence of statements for taint analysis. This enhancement allows us to
  accurately track tainted values during object initialization. (gh-7742)

- Allow any characters in file paths used to create dotted rule IDs. File path
  characters that aren't allowed in rule IDs are simply removed. For example, a
  rule whose ID is `my-rule` found in the file `hello/@world/rules.yaml`
  becomes `hello.world.my-rule`. (gh-8057)
- Diff aware scans now work when git state isn't clean (pa-2795)

## [1.27.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v1.27.0) - 2023-06-13

### Added

- PHP: Added composer ecosystem parser (gh-7734)
- Pro: taint-mode: Java: Semgrep can now relate Java properties and their corresponding
  getters/setters even when these are autogenerated (so the actual getters/setters are
  not declared in the sources). (pa-2833)

### Fixed

- semgrep-core now validates rule IDs. This should not affect users since rule
  ID validation is done by the Python wrapper. (gh-8026)

## [1.26.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v1.26.0) - 2023-06-09

### Added

- In Java, Semgrep can now track taint through more getters and setters. It could already relate setters to getters (e.g. `o.setX(taint); o.getX()` but now it can relate setters and getters to properties (e.g. `o.setX(taint); o.x`). (getters)
- taint-mode: Added experimental options `taint_assume_safe_booleans` and
  `taint_assume_safe_numbers` to avoid propagating taint coming from expressions
  with Boolean or number (integer, float) types. (pa-2777)

### Fixed

- swift: Support if let shorthand for shadowing an existing optional variable. (gh-7583)
- Elixir: fix the string extraction used for -filter_irrelevant_rules (gh-7855)
- Fixed comparison of taint information that was causing duplicate taints to be tracked.
  Interfile analysis on large repos will see a small speedup. (misc-1)
- taint-mode: Fixed performance regression in 1.24.0 that affected taint rules. (pa-2777-1)
- Fix a recent regression that caused failures to match in certain cases that combined metavariable-regex and typed metavariables which themselves contain metavariables (e.g. in Go `($X: $T)` with a `metavariable-regex` operating on `$T`). (pa-2822)
- Gomod comments: fix parsing comments that end in ')' (sc-716)

## [1.25.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v1.25.0) - 2023-06-06

### Added

- aliengrep: new option 'generic_caseless' to achieve case-insensitive matching (gh-7883)
- Semgrep now includes heuristics based on the Java standard library and common naming patterns. These allow Semgrep to determine the types of more expressions in Java, for use with typed metavariables (https://semgrep.dev/docs/writing-rules/pattern-syntax/#typed-metavariables). (heuristics)
- Language server now supports search (and replace) with semgrep patterns through semgrep/search (ls-search)
- Language Server will now notify users of errors, and reason for crash (pa-2791)

### Fixed

- Pro (taint analysis): Check function calls without parameters or parenthesis in Ruby (gh-7787)
- Aliengrep: ellipsis patterns that would be useless because of being placed
  at the extremity of a pattern (always) or a line (in single-mode) are now
  anchored to the beginning/end of input/line. For example, `...` in multiline
  mode matches the whole input rather than matching nothing many times. (gh-7881)
- Fixed bug in constant propagation that made Semgrep fail to compute the value of
  an integer constant when this was obtained via the multiplication of two other
  constants. (gh-7893)
- Fix regexps potentially vulnerable to ReDoS attacks in Python code for parsing
  git URLs. Sets maximum length of git URLs to 1024 characters since parsing is
  still perceptibly slow on 5000-byte input. Reported by Sebastian Chnelik,
  PyUp.io. (gh-7943)

## [1.24.1](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v1.24.1) - 2023-06-01

### Fixed

- Yarn v1: fix parsing for package headers without version constraints (sc-749)

## [1.24.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v1.24.0) - 2023-05-31

### Added

- New experimental aliengrep engine that can be used as an alternative to the
  default spacegrep engine with `options.generic_engine: aliengrep`. (aliengrep)
- Pro: Taint labels now mostly work interprocedurally, except for labeled propagators.
  Note that taint labels are experimental! (pa-2507)
- Pro: Taint-mode now supports inter-procedural field-sensitivity for JS/TS.

  For example, given this class:

  ```javascript
  class Obj {
    constructor(x, y) {
      this.x = x;
      this.y = y;
    }
  }
  ```

  Semgrep knows that an object constructed by `new Obj("tainted", "safe")` has its
  `x` attribute tainted, whereas its `y` attribute is safe. (pa-2570)

### Changed

- Set limits to the amount of taint that is tracked by Semgrep to prevent perf
  issues. (pa-2570)

### Fixed

- Allow symbolic propagation for rvals in lhs of assignments. (gh-6780)
- XML: you can now use metavariable-comparison on XML attributes or XML text body (gh-7709)
- Java: support for record patterns (gh-7911)
- C#: support ellipsis in enum declarations (gh-7914)
- Fixed a recent regression which caused typed metavariables to fail to match when
  the type itself also contained a metavariable, and the target was a builtin
  type. For example, the pattern `(List<$T> $X)` would fail to match a value of
  type `List<String>`. (typed-mvar)

## [1.23.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v1.23.0) - 2023-05-24

### Added

- On scan complete during logged in `semgrep ci` scans, check returned exit code to
  see if should block scans. This is to support incoming features that requires
  information from semgrep.dev (complete)
- Extract mode: users can now choose to include or exclude rules to run on, similar to `paths:`. For example,
  to only run on the rules `example-1` and `example-2`, you would write

  ```
  rules:
     - id: test-rule
       mode: extract
       rules:
          include:
          - example-1
          - example-2
  ```

  To run on everything except `example-1` and `example-2`, you would write

  ````
  rules:
     - id: test-rule
       mode: extract
       rules:
          exclude:
          - example-1
          - example-2
  ``` (gh-7858)
  ````

- Kotlin: Added literal metavariables, from patterns like `"$FOO"`.
  You can still match strings that only contain a single interpolated
  ident by using the brace notation, e.g. `"${FOO}"`. (pa-2755)
- Increase timeout of `semgrep ci` upload findings network calls
  and make said timeout configurable with env var SEMGREP_UPLOAD_FINDINGS_TIMEOUT (timeout)

### Changed

- Relaxed restrictions on symbolic propagation so that symbolic values survive
  branching statements. Now (with symbolic-propagation enabled) `foo(bar())` will
  match match the following code:

  ```python
  def test():
    x = bar()
    if cond:
      exit()
    foo(x)
  ```

  Previously any symbolically propagated value was lost after any kind of branching
  statement. (pa-2739)

### Fixed

- swift: support ellipsis metavariable (gh-7666)
- Scala: You can now put an ellipsis inside of a `catch`, to
  write a pattern like:
  try {
  ...
  } catch {
  ...
  }
  which will match every kind of try-catch. (gh-7807)
- When scanning with `-l dockerfile`, files named `dockerfile` as well as `Dockerfile` will be scanned. (gh-7824)
- Fix for very long runtimes that could happen due to one of our optimizations. We now detect when that might
  happen and skip the optimization. (gh-7839)
- Improve type inference for some simple arithmetic expressions (inference)
- Fixed bug introduced in 1.19.0 that was causing some stack overflows. (pa-2740)

## [1.22.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v1.22.0) - 2023-05-15

### Added

- Add support for language Cairo 1.0 (develop). Thanks to Frostweeds (Romain Jufer) for his contribution! (gh-7757)
- On logged in `semgrep ci` scans, report lockfile parse errors to display in webUI (lockfileparse)
- Pro: Java: Taint-mode can now do field-sensitive analysis of class constructors.
  For example, if the default constructor of a class `C` sets its field `x` to a
  tainted value, given `o = new C()`, Semgrep will know that `o.getX()` is tainted. (pa-2570)
- Kotlin: Added named ellipses, like $...X (pa-2710)
- Kotlin: Interpolated identifiers in strings, such as "$foo", are now properly
  able to match explicitly interpolated expressions, like "${...}". (pa-2711)

### Changed

- Cleanup: Removed Bloom filter optimization. This optimization had been turned off by
  default since September 2022 (release 0.116.0) without any noticeable effect. It had
  its role in the past when it was first introduced, but now it's time for it to go! (cleanup-1)
- engine: The use of a matching cache for statements is now disabled by default,
  please let us know if you notice any performance degradation. We plan to remove
  this optimization in a few weeks. (cleanup-2)

### Fixed

- Enable automatic removal of matched codes by allowing an empty string in the fix field. (gh-6318)
- Updated SARIF to use nested levels, added confidence to tags and included references with markdown links. (gh-7317)
- taint-mode: Fixed bug in taint labels that was causing some fatal errors:
  > Failure "Call AST_utils.with_xxx_equal to avoid this error." (gh-7694)

## [1.21.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v1.21.0) - 2023-05-04

### Added

- Scala: Most Scala 3 features can now be parsed (pa-2748)

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where parentheses were incorrectly removed when autofixing JS/TS code. (gh-6233)
- Fixed issue where the semgrep language server would crash with "No such file or directory: 'semgrep-core'" (pa-2745)

## [1.20.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v1.20.0) - 2023-04-28

### Added

- Pro: Taint: Added support for simple cases of interprocedural taint labels (pa-2708)
- Language Server has been moved to OCaml core, with major speed improvements (pa-lsp)

### Changed

- Pro: `semgrep --pro` still requires a single target, but this target no longer
  needs to be a directory, it can be an individual file too. (misc-1)
- Partially analyzed files are no longer reported as skipped by --verbose. And if we
  lack info about what lines have been skipped we no longer report that all lines have
  been skipped. That was not accurate. For example, an error while evaluating a
  `metavariable-pattern` operator in one rule may cause a finding to be missed, and
  the file being reported as partially analyzed. However, that error did not affect
  any other rules, and even the affected rule may be able to produce some findings. (pa-2683)

### Fixed

- CLI: Fixed a bug where Git projects with URLs with subgroups would not parse correctly,
  and produce non-clickable links in Semgrep App. These are such as:
  https://gitlab.com/example/group2/group3/test-case.git (pa-2669)
- Taint: Fixed a bug where the new labeled propagators would sometimes not behave properly (pa-2682)
- Swift: Made it so that taint correctly propagates into
  the bodies of lambdas (pa-2718)
- Pro Engine: Fixed a bug where dataflow analysis would sometimes
  loop when analyzing interprocedural `get<name>` methods in a
  loop. (pro-56)
- The scan progress bar no longer gets stuck displaying 0% (zero-progress)

## [1.19.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v1.19.0) - 2023-04-21

### Added

- Java: Private static variables that are defined just once in a static block,
  even if they are not declared `final`, will be considered as `final` by
  constant-propagation. (pa-2228)
- Scala: Can now parse indented matches, like:

  e match
  case foo => "foo"
  case bar => "bar" (pa-2687)

- Scala: Can now parse arguments with `using`, as well as splatted arguments.

  E.g. foo(using bar) and foo(1, 2, bar\*) (pa-2688)

- Scala: Added parsing of `enum` constructs. (pa-2691)
- Scala: Can now parse `given` definitions (pa-2692)
- Scala: Can now parse `export`s (pa-2693)
- Scala: Can now parse top-level definitions (as added in Scala 3) (pa-2694)
- Scala: Can now parse indented `for` expression, such as

  for
  \_ <- 5
  yield
  ... (pa-2695)

- The title of Supply Chain findings will now consist of the package name and CVE,
  instead of just the rule's UUID. (sc-580)

### Changed

- The different lists of skipped files output by Semgrep when given --verbose will
  now be sorted, to make it easier to `diff` the outputs of two runs. (pa-2700)

### Fixed

- CLI: Setting Semgrep-specific environment variables for metadata (like
  SEMGREP_REPO_NAME, SEMGREP_REPO_URL, SEMGREP_PR_ID, and friends) now
  properly works on GitHub and GitLab CI scans.

  If not set, functionality is same as before. (pa-2644)

- CLI: Fixed a bug where repositories with a dot in the name would cause
  semgrep ci scans to crash (pa-2655)

## [1.18.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v1.18.0) - 2023-04-14

### Added

- Metavariable comparison: Added support for \*\*, the exponentiation operator. (gh-7474)
- Pro: Java: Semgrep is now able to track the propagation of taint from the
  arguments of a method, to the object being called. So e.g. given a method

      public void foo(int x) {
          this.x = x;
      }

  and a call `o.foo(tainted)`, Semgrep will be able to track that the field
  `x` of `o` has been tainted. (pa-2570)

- Kotlin: Class fields will now receive the correct types, and be
  found by typed metavariables correctly

  This applies to examples such as:
  class Foo {
  var x : int
  }
  for the variable `x` (pa-2684)

- Supply Chain support for package-lock.json version 3 (sc-586)

### Fixed

- metavariable-pattern: When used with the nested `language` key, if there was an
  error parsing the `metavariable`'s content, that error could abort the analysis
  of the current file. If there were other rules that were going to produce findings
  on that file, those findings were not being reported. (gh-7271)
- Matching: Fixed a bug where explicit casts of expressions would produce two matches to
  other explicit casts.

  So for instance, a pattern `(int $X)` in Java would match twice to `(int) 5`. (gh-7403)

- taint-mode: Given `x = tainted`, then `x.a = safe`, then `x.a.b = tainted`, Semgrep
  did not report `sink(x.a.b)`. Because `x.a` was clean, that made Semgrep disregard
  the tainting of any field of `x.a` such as `x.a.b`. This now works as expected. (pa-2486)
- When using `metavariable-pattern` to match embedded PHP code, Semgrep was
  unconditionally adding the `<?php` opening to the embedded code. When
  `<?php` was already present, this caused parsing errors. (pa-2696)
- Lockfile-only supply chain findings correctly include line numbers in their match data, improving the appearence of CLI output (sc-658)
- Increase timeout for `semgrep install-semgrep-pro` to avoid failures when the download is slow. (timeout)
- Fixed the range reported by findings for YAML files that include an anchor, so that the match does not include the original location of the snippet bound to the anchor. (yaml-alias)

## [1.17.1](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v1.17.1) - 2023-04-05

### Fixed

- Fix an issue that could lead to a crash when printing findings that contain snippets that look like markup to the Rich Python library (rich-markup-crash)

## [1.17.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v1.17.0) - 2023-04-04

### Added

- Scala: Added proper parsing for Scala 3 style imports (pa-2678)

### Changed

- taint-mode: Added option `taint_assume_safe_comparisons`, disabled by default, that
  prevents comparison operators to propagate taint, so e.g. `tainted != "something"`
  will not be considered tainted. Note that this a syntactic check, if the operator
  is overloaded to perform a different operation this will not be detected. (pa-2645)

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where incorrect ranges for expressions containing parentheses could lead Semgrep to generate invalid autofixes in Python. (gh-2902)
- In rare cases, Semgrep could generate invalid autofixes where Python keyword arguments were placed before positional arguments. When using AST-based autofix, it no longer makes that error. (keywordarg-autofix)

## [1.16.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v1.16.0) - 2023-03-30

### Added

- Kotlin: Added support for typed metavariables. You can write a pattern like:
  ($X : String)
  to find all instances of expressions with type String. (pa-2648)
- Scala: Semgrep can now parse programs that contain quoted expressions, context
  parameter clauses using `using`, and soft modifiers like `inline` and `open`. (pa-2672)
- Scala: Can now parse programs containing matches on types, such as:
  type t = K match {
  case Int => String
  } (pa-2673)
- Parsing rules can take multiple seconds at the start of a scan.
  When running in an interactive terminal with more than 500 rules,
  Semgrep will show a progress bar for this step. (rule-progress)

### Changed

- Supply Chain scans will now understand `maven_dep_tree.txt` files
  that are made of multiple smaller `maven_dep_tree.txt` files concatenated with `cat`. (maven-dep-forest)
- Findings of a scan are now printed with section headers per group for the following categories:
  Code Blocking, Code Non-blocking, Supply Chain Reachable, Supply Chain Unreachable findings. (results-headings)
- Switched to using go.mod files to read go dependencies for Semgrep Supply Chain, instead of go.sum files (sc-gomod)

### Fixed

- Clojure: parse 'foo/bar' as two separate tokens, so one can use
  metavariable in it and get '$X/bar' to match 'foo/bar' (gh-7311)
- HTML/XML: support attribute as pattern (e.g., `foo="true"`) (gh-7344)
- Improved significantly the time to parse big rulesets such as p/default
  from 20s to a few seconds by parsing patterns lazily and by
  not using /tmp to parse those patterns. (pa-2597)
- Pipfiles with a line comment or inline comment will now parse correctly. (sc-664)

## [1.15.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v1.15.0) - 2023-03-15

### Added

- On full sca scans with dep search feature on, send dependency data for dep search (depsearch)
- metavariable-comparison: Added support for bitwise operators `~`, `&`, `|` and `^`. (gh-7284)
- Taint: `pattern-propagators` now have optional fields `requires` and `label`,
  which are used identically to their counterparts in `pattern-sources` and ` pattern-sinks`, for the experimental taint labels feature.

  For instance, we can define:

  ```
  pattern-propagators:
    - pattern: |
        $TO.foo($FROM)
      from: $FROM
      to: $TO
      requires: A
      replace-labels: [A, C]
      label: B
  ```

  to denote a propagator which only propagates from $FROM to $TO if $FROM has
  taint label A. In addition, it converts any taints from $TO with labels
  A or C to have label B.

  If `label` is not specified, the `to` is tainted with the same label of taint
  that $FROM has. If `requires` is not specified, it does not require $FROM to
  have a particular label of taint.

  Additionally, `replace-labels` only restricts the label being propagated if
  the output `label` is specified. (pa-1633)

- taint-mode: Java: Support for basic field sensitivity via getters and setters.
  Given `obj.setX(tainted)`, Semgrep will identify that a subsequent `obj.getX()`
  carries the same taint as `tainted`. It will also differentiate between
  `obj.getX()` and `obj.getY()`. Note that Semgrep does not examine the definitions
  for the getter or setter methods, and it does not know whether e.g. some other
  method `obj.clearX()` clears the taint that `obj.setX(tainted)` adds. (pa-2585)
- Pro Engine: Semgrep CLI will now download a version of Semgrep Pro Engine
  compatible with the current version of Semgrep CLI, as opposed to the most
  recently released version.

  This behavior is only supported for Semgrep 1.12.1 and later. Previous
  versions will still download the most recently released version, as before. (pa-2595)

### Changed

- Pro: `semgrep ci` will run intrafile interprocedural taint analysis by default
  in differential scans (aka PR scans). (Note that interfile analysis is not run
  in differential scans for performance reasons.) (pa-2565)
- Remove custom _entrypoint_ for returntocorp/semgrep Docker images, now you must
  explicitly call semgrep.

  This won't work now: `docker run -v $(pwd):/src returntocorp/semgrep scan ...`
  Must do this instead: `docker run -v $(pwd):/src returntocorp/semgrep semgrep scan ...` (pa-2642)

- Changed Maven version comparison to more closely reflect usage, so versions with more than 3 increments will not be treated as plain strings (sc-656)

### Fixed

- The AST dump produced by semgrep-core is now usable from Python
  with the provided ATD interface and the Python code derived from it with
  atdpy. (gh-7296)
- Terraform: Nested blocks can now be used as sources and sinks for taint.
  For instance, the block `x` in

  resource $A $B {
  x {
  ...
  }
  } (pa-2475)

- CLI: The scan progress bar now shows progress with higher granularity, and has fewer big jumps when using the Pro Engine.

  The abstract unit of 'tasks' has been removed, and now only a percentage number will be displayed. (pa-2526)

- Fix an error with rule targeting for extract mode. Previously, if a ruleset had
  two rules, the first being the extract rule, the second being the rule to run,
  no rules would run on the extracted targets. Additionally, with multiple rules
  the wrong rule might be run on the extracted target, causing errors. Now, in
  extract mode all the rules for the destination language will be run. (pa-2591)
- Metrics: logged in `semgrep ci` scans now send metrics, as our Privacy.md indicates
  (previously they incorrectly did not, which made it harder for us to track failure events) (pa-2592)
- Rust: Basic let-statement bindings (such as `let x = tainted`) now properly
  carry taint. (pa-2605)
- Improved error reporting for rule parsing by correctly reporting parse errors
  instead of engine errors in certain cases. (pa-2610)
- Taint: Fixed an issue where an error could be thrown if semgrep-core's output
  contained a dataflow trace without a sink. (pa-2625)
- Julia: Properly allow string literal metavariables like "$A" to be patterns. (pa-2630)

## [1.14.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v1.14.0) - 2023-03-01

### Added

- Add new hashes of a match (finding) to send to the app:
  - code_hash
  - pattern_hash
  - start_line_hash
  - end-line_hash (gh-7218)

### Changed

- taint-mode: Historically, the matching of taint sinks has been somewhat imprecise.
  For example, `sink(ok if tainted else ok)` was flagged. Recently, we made sink-
  matching more precise for sinks like `sink(...)` declaring that any argument of
  a given function is a sink. Now we make it more precise when specific arguments of
  a function are sinks, like:

  ```yaml
  pattern-sinks:
    - patterns:
        - pattern: sink($X, ...)
        - focus-metavariable: $X
  ```

  So `sink(ok1 if tainted else ok2)`, `sink(not_a_propagator(tainted))`, and
  `sink(some_array[tainted])`, will not be reported as findings. (pa-2477)

- The `--gitlab-sast` and `--gitlab-secrets` output formats have been upgraded.
  The output is now valid with the GitLab v15 schema,
  while staying valid with the GitLab v14 schema as well.
  Code findings now include the confidence of the rule.
  Supply Chain findings now include the exposure type. (sc-635)

### Fixed

- Fix: Semgrep Pro previously reported a crash for user errors such as
  invalid patterns. It will now give a good error message. (gh-7028)
- Dataflow: Fixed incorrect translation of side-effects inside Boolean expressions,
  this was (for example) causing `if (cond && x = 42) S1; S2` to be interpreted as
  `x = 42; if (cond && x) S1; S2`, thus incorrectly flagging `x` as a constant
  inside S2. (gh-7199)
- Solidity: support enum and event patterns (gh-7230)
- Kotlin: allow to match extended class in any order
  (e.g., the pattern `class $X : Foo` will also match `class Stuff : Bar, Foo`). (gh-7248)
- taint-mode: Code such as `sink(sanitizer(source) if source else ok)` will not be
  incorrectly reported as a tainted sink. This follows a previous attempt at fixing
  these issues in version 1.1.0. (pa-2509)
- metavariable-pattern: Fixed regression introduced in version 1.9.0 that broke
  the use of `pattern-not` within `metavariable-pattern` in some cases. (pa-2510)
- Make Semgrep parse HTML-style comments in JavaScript code. (pa-2560)
- Reduced peak memory usage during inter-file analysis (pa-2563)
- Supply Chain scans on a project using Pipenv
  will now detect transitivity from the committed Pipfile,
  instead of printing an error while trying to parse it. (pa-2577)
- `--oss-only` previously required `--oss-only true` to be passed. This PR fixes
  it so that `--oss-only` will invoke the oss engine. Note that `--oss-only true`
  will no longer be supported (pa-2587)

## [1.13.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v1.13.0) - 2023-02-24

### Added

- Detect `BITBUCKET_TOKEN` from environment to authenticate with the Bitbucket API. (app-3691)
- taint-mode: Taint propagators can now specify `by-side-effect`, just like sources and
  sanitizers. However, the default value of `by-side-effect` for propagators is `true`
  (unlike for sources or sanitizers). When using rule option
  `taint_assume_safe_functions: true`, this allows to specify functions that must
  propagate taint, for example:
  ```yaml
  pattern-propagators:
    - by-side-effect: false
      patterns:
        - pattern-inside: $F(..., $X, ...)
        - focus-metavariable: $F
        - pattern-either:
            - pattern: unsafe_function
      from: $X
      to: $F
  ```
  Without `by-side-effect: true`, `unsafe_function` itself would be tainted by side-
  effect, and subsequent invokations of this function, even if the arguments were safe,
  would be tainted. (pa-2400)
- CLI: SARIF output now includes a tag pertaining to which card of the Rule Board a rule originated from.
  This can be "rule-board-block", "rule-board-audit", or "rule-board-pr-comments". (pa-2519)

### Fixed

- Fixed a couple of typos in help/usage. (gh-7184)
- Matching: Fixed a bug where expressions would not match to explicit type casts of matching expressions (pa-1133)
- Golang: Fixed a bug where metavariable ellipses as parameters to functions were not working properly (pa-2545)
- Apex: Fix name resolution of class attributes. Among other things, this will allow
  Semgrep to perform constant propagation of `final` class attributes.
  See https://semgrep.dev/s/DG6v. (pa-2551)
- Go: Fixed a bug where function arguments in a group that share the same type,
  such as "func foo(x, y, z int)", would parse all arguments after the first as
  having the name ",". For instance, "y" and "z" here would not have the correct
  names. (pa-2558)
- Fixed bug in comparison of Maven versions where multi digit versions would cause a default to raw string comparison (sc-maven-cmp-bug)

## [1.12.1](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v1.12.1) - 2023-02-17

### Fixed

- Fix local scan hyperlinks by asking git for remote.origin.url if repo_url not provided (gh-7144)
- Improve error messages displayed with `--verbose` when the contents of a metavariable fails to parse. (pa-2537)
- Fixed parsing bug maven_dep_tree.txt files where dependency specs with 6 fields, or suffixed with `(optional)` would fail to parse (sc-622)
- Supply Chain rules now correctly understand Maven version strings, as described in https://docs.oracle.com/middleware/1212/core/MAVEN/maven_version.htm#MAVEN8855 (sc-maven-versions)
- package-lock.json files which contain `"resolved": false` as a result of a bug in NPM will now parse (sc-npm-bug)

## [1.12.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v1.12.0) - 2023-02-13

### Fixed

- CLI: No longer reports rules as being run with a lack of `interfile: true` when interfile
  analysis was not requested. (pa-2528)
- The 1.11.0 release started printing log lines to stderr even when --quiet was
  on, making it impossible to get well-formed JSON output when mixing stdout and
  stderr. These lines are now gone, and output is again restricted to just scan
  results. (quiet-please)
- Output lines in GitHub Actions logs could appear scrambled, due to GitHub
  Actions mixing together the stdout and stderr streams in non-deterministic
  order. Semgrep will now log everything only to one stream in GitHub Actions
  when using text output mode, which ensures lines no longer appear scrambled.
  (sc-607)

## [1.11.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v1.11.0) - 2023-02-10

### Changed

- Pro: Removed already deprecated flags `--deep` (now `--pro`), `--interfile` (now `--pro`),
  and `--interproc` (now `--pro-intrafile`). Also removed already deprecated command
  `install-deep-semgrep` (now `install-semgrep-pro`). (pa-2518)

### Fixed

- Go: Fixed a bug where the location of Go raw string literals were not being reported correctly.
  This could cause issues with Playground range highlighting and autofix (pa-2206)
- CLI: Progress bar for Semgrep Pro Engine interfile scans now reflects actual progress more faithfully (pa-2313)
- Pro: We now check the downloaded binary before installing it, this should prevent
  installation of corrupted binaries due to errors during the download. (pa-2492)
- Fix the location associated with metavariables bound inside of
  `metavariable-pattern` clauses, which could lead to matches being incorrectly
  displayed. (extracted-metavar-loc)
- CLI: Fixed bug with `semgrep --validate` for metavariables like $1, $2.
  Previously, it blocked rules that it shouldn't. (validate-regex-mvar)

## [1.10.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v1.10.0) - 2023-02-08

### Added

- Experimental support for XML (gh-5939)
- Rust: Beta support for Rust. (gh-6545)
- Rule syntax: Metavariable bindings bound within `metavariable-pattern` now persist to outside of the `metavariable-pattern` (pa-2490)
- Updated all lockfile parsers (except Cargo.lock) to produce better error messages, at the cost of a couple seconds of lowdown on large (>10k lines) lockfiles (sc-better-parsers)
- Allow metavariable-pattern clauses that use `language: generic` to run (and
  potentially match) on any metavariable binding kind, not just strings. For
  example, with the pattern `foo($...ARGS)`, it is now possible to use a
  `metavariable-pattern` on `$...ARGS` with `language: generic`, and match using
  generic mode against whatever text `$...ARGS` is bound to.
  (metavar-pattern-generic)
- Print handy links to review results on Semgrep App when a CI scan uploads
  findings. (sc-564)
- Allow metavariable ellipsis in template literals, e.g. `$...X${1 + 2}`
  (template-metavar-ellipsis)

### Changed

- Pro: `--pro` will now enable _all_ Pro features, including Apex, inter-procedural taint
  analysis, and also inter-file analysis for supported languages. For Apex support only
  (and more languages in the future) now use `--pro-languages`. For intra-file analysis
  only now use `--pro-intrafile`. Flags `--interproc` and `--interfile` are now
  deprecated. (pa-2488)
- The output formatting of semgrep ci is getting revamped in the coming weeks.
  This release includes the first couple changes to the output. (sc-590)
- Packages from the maven ecosystem are now parsed to include their org slug. This means a log4j rule must now use `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core` instead of just `log4j-core`. This change is backwards incompatible, in that any Java Supply Chain rules not taking into account will stop producing any findings, since the packages parsed from lockfiles will include the org, but the old rules will not. (sc-maven-org)
- Add the engine requested by the user to the metrics (pa-2427)

### Fixed

- Rust: correctly parse the last expression in blocks (gh-7071)
- Dataflow traces: Findings now always display the separating line with `--dataflow-traces` in the CLI, to reduce
  confusion over where the findings fall between the dataflow traces. (pa-2471)
- CLI: Added `install-semgrep-pro` to the list of commands in the `semgrep --help` help text. (pa-2505)
- Fixed bug where gradle.lockfile files would fail to parse if they contained a trailing newline, and bug where an error on a trailing newline would cause our lockfile parse error pretty printing to fail (sc-trailing-newline)

## [1.9.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v1.9.0) - 2023-02-01

### Added

- Pro: If the "Semgrep Pro Engine" toggle is enabled in App, `semgrep ci` will add
  support for Apex in all scans (including diff scans). (pa-2462)

### Fixed

- Fix incorrectly reformatted Bitbucket repository URLs (app-3279)

## [1.8.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v1.8.0) - 2023-02-01

### Added

- Experimental support for Clojure, Lisp, and Scheme. (gh-3328)
- Experimental support for Jsonnet (writing semgrep rules to find
  bugs/security-isses/... in jsonnet files). (pa-1849)

### Fixed

- Regexps within string patterns such as `"=~/hello/"` now support the
  full PCRE syntax, including backreferences and other advanced features
  not supported by ocaml-re. (gh-6913)
- Removed new lockfile parsers for all lockfiles except requirements.txt and maven_dep_tree.txt, for performance reasons (sc-557)

## [1.6.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v1.6.0) - 2023-01-27

### Added

- Added exposure property to sarif output for sca findings (sarif)

### Changed

- Tests: Allow `--test` to process entire file trees rather than single files (gh-5487)
- metavariable-pattern: For performance reasons Generic mode ignores target files
  that look like machine generated. Unfortunately, this also prevented using the
  `metavariable-pattern` operator on text that may look like (or in fact be)
  machine generated, such as an RSA key contained in a legit file. Now, when the
  analysis is requested within a `metavariable-pattern` operator, Generic mode
  will always match any text even if it looks like machine generated. (pa-2386)
- Pro: Add **experimental** flags `--pro` and `--interproc`. Using `--pro` you can
  enable Apex support, and with `--fast-deep` you can enable intra-file inter-procedural
  taint analysis. Also, `--deep` has been renamed to `--interfile`. Note that to use
  any of the Pro features you must first run `semgrep install-semgrep-pro` while being
  logged in. (pa-2440)
- New lockfile parsers with better error messages for all supported ecosystems except Rust (sc-495)

### Fixed

- Solidity: parse correctly 'unchecked' blocks (gh-6055)
- Terraform: Implicit coercions between strings, bools, ints, and floats are now allowed to match. (gh-6898)
- Python: Taint now propagates via the splat operators `*` and `**`, thus both
  `sink(*tainted)` and `sink(**tainted)` will result in findings. (gh-6920)
- Solidity: support ellipsis in contract inheritance
  Thanks to Raz0r for his contribution! (gh-6935)
- CLI: No longer fails when running tests against a config file with no rules in it (gh-6954)
- Fixed a crash that could occur when using the GitHub API to fetch the merge base rather than computing it locally. (merge-base)
- JS/TS: Object types now support metavariables properly (pa-2414)
- CLI: No longer reports the wrong command if you are using the `semgrep-core-proprietary` executable. (pa-2417)
- Pro: Findings that occur due to rules run with the Semgrep Pro Engine are now displayed separately in the CLI. (pa-2432)
- Fixed bug where Semgrep would generate reachable findings for transitive dependencies, even if a direct dependency at a safe version exists (sc-547)
- Fixed bug in poetry.lock parser where quoted square brackets could cause failures (sc-548)
- Fixed bug where Semgrep would fail to generate unreachable findings for a particular library if a reachable finding for that library had already been found in the same lockfile, even if there are multiple copies of this library at different vulnerable versions. (sc-549)
- Fixed bug where npm lockfiles with packages that listed multiples hashes would fail to parse (sc-550)

## [1.5.1](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v1.5.1) - 2023-01-20

### Added

- Python: Constant propagation will now recognize the idiom `cond and X or Y`,
  as well as `True and X` and `False or X`. So e.g. `cond and "a" or "b"` will
  be identified as a constant string. (gh-6079)
- Julia: Julia is now experimental (pa-2366)

### Changed

- DeepSemgrep is now Semgrep PRO! To install the Semgrep PRO engine run:
  `semgrep install-semgrep-pro`. This engine is still invoked using the
  `--deep` flag, but please expect changes to the CLI in the near future.
  The new Semgrep PRO engine adds support for Apex! (pa-2389)

### Fixed

- New 'transform:' field in extract mode rules, with 'concat_json_string_array'
  option useful to extract python code from jupyter notebooks.
  Thanks to Jose Selvi for his contribution! (gh-4477)
- Java: Fixed regression introduced in 0.123.0 that could cause a private class
  attribute to be incorrectly regarded as a constant. (gh-6793)
- Make `$F(x)` match `eval(x)`. Previously, `eval` was special-cased and metavariable function call patterns would not match it. (gh-6877)
- DeepSemgrep: Enabled `--dataflow-traces` by default when `--deep` is specified (pa-2274)
- In rare situations, mainly in DeepSemgrep and related to naming bugs, the use of
  symbolic propagation could make Semgrep fall into an infinite loop during matching.
  This has been fixed by bounding the number of times that Semgrep can follow
  symbolically-propagated values. (pa-2324)
- CLI: Made an error message for when two autofix matches overlap have a more helpful message, as well as be displayed as a debug message. (pa-2393)
- CLI: Made the warning message when using Semgrep Pro more friendly when logged in (pa-2396)

## [1.3.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v1.3.0) - 2023-01-04

### Changed

- Removed the poor support for reading dependencies from pom.xml files. Instead semgrep will try to read dependencies from a maven_dep_tree.txt file,
  which can be generated using the command `mvn dependency:tree -DoutputFile=maven_dep_tree.txt` (sc-pom)

### Fixed

- Use the GitHub REST API when possible to compute the merge base for `semgrep ci`, improving performance on shallow clones of large repositories. (gha-mergebase)
- YAML: Fixed a bug where metavariables matching YAML double-quoted strings would not capture the entire range of the string, and would
  not contain the double-quotes. Also added the ability to properly use patterns like `"$FOO"`, which will unpack the contents of the matched string. (pa-2332)
- Fixed a race condition related to the parsing cache that could lead to internal errors (pa-2335)
- YAML: Fixed a bug where literal or folded blocks would not be parsed properly.

  So for instance, in:

  ```
  key: |
    string goes here
  ```

  A metavariable matching the contents of the string value might not be correct. (pa-2347)

- Julia: Greatly improved parsing support (pa-2362)

## [1.2.1](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v1.2.1) - 2022-12-16

### Fixed

- Go: fix NoTokenLocation for metavariables matching function type without
  an argument (e.g. `func()`) (gh-6715)
- typed-metavariables: handle ternary expressions so we can type correctly
  expressions like `foo(cond ? new A() : this.a)` (pa-2328)
- Reverted a change which caused findings with different sources (but the same sink) to be deduplicated. This would cause findings which
  looked identical in range and data, but had different taint traces. (pa-2336)

## [1.2.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v1.2.0) - 2022-12-15

### Fixed

- Fixed rare crash that could occur due to stale file caches when temp file names overlap (cache-invalidation)
- PHP: support metavariables in string (as in `foo("$VAR")`) (gh-6311)
- Java: support static block patterns (gh-6366)
- Rust: parse correctly scoped identifier in constructor (gh-6594)
- Java: support `super(...)` patterns (gh-6638)
- C#: bugfix on bad interaction between -fast and the internal code generated
  for LINQ queries (gh-6666)
- Java: support the Java 10 'var' keyword by not using 'var' as a valid type when
  using typed metavariables. (gh-6672)
- When matching module specifiers in imports, prevent metavariables from capturing quotes. (gh-6674)
- Swift: support complex expression in switch case (gh-6704)
- Constant propagation: Fixed a bug where constant propagation would only run within functions. Now,
  it runs on the top-level of the program as well. (pa-1656)
- DeepSemgrep: Fixed a bug where imports which reached type names (among other things) would not resolve properly (pa-2260)
- DeepSemgrep: Fixed a bug which caused Java functions with interfaces to wipe taint (instead of propagating taint by default) (pa-2265)
- Fix matching of qualified names. For example, `new $X.Foo()` will now match
  `new a.b.Foo()`. (pa-2296)
- DeepSemgrep: Fix regression in taint-mode introduced by Semgrep v1.1 that caused
  some findings to be missed. Also, DeepSemgrep will assume, for now, that a method
  call on a tainted object is always tainted. (pa-2304)
- Improved matching behavior on JS `require` calls (require-match)

## [1.1.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v1.1.0) - 2022-12-05

### Added

- JSON output: Added a `max_memory_bytes` field to the `semgrep --time` output which corresponds to the amount of memory allocated during the OCaml phase of Semgrep. This is useful for telemetry purposes. (pa-2075)

### Changed

- Don't print out summary of blocking rules unless running with semgrep ci subcommand (gh-6651)

### Fixed

- taint-mode: In 0.94.0 we made that when a `pattern-source` (or `pattern-sanitizer`)
  matched a variable exactly, this was understood as that variable being tainted
  (sanitized, resp.) by side-effect. For example, given `tainted(x)` we would taint `x`
  by side-effect, and subsequent occurrences of `x` were also considered tainted.
  This allowed to write rules like `c.lang.security.use-after-free.use-after-free`
  in a very succint way, and it also addressed some limitations of the workarounds that
  were being used to simulate this until then.

  This worked well initially, or so we thought, until in 0.113.0 we added
  field-sensitivity to taint-mode, and in subsequent versions we made sources and
  sanitizers apply by side-effect to more kinds of l-values than just simple variables.
  It was then that we started to see regressions that were fairly unintuitive for users.
  For example, if `$_GET['foo']` was a taint source, this would make `$_GET` itself to
  be tainted by side-effect, and a subsequent expression like `$_GET['bar']` was also
  considered tainted.

  We now correct the situation by adding the `by-side-effect` option to sources and
  sanitizers, and requiring this option to be explicitly enabled
  (that is, `by-side-effect: true`) in order to apply the source or the sanitizer by
  side-effect. Otherwise, the default is that sources and sanitizers matching l-values
  apply only to the precise occurrences that they match. (pa-1629)

- taint-mode: Fixed matching of `pattern-sinks` to be more precise, so that e.g.
  it will no longer report `sink(ok1 if tainted else ok2)` as a tainted sink, as
  the expression passed to the `sink` is actually not tainted. (pa-2142)
- CLI: Separated experimental rules from normal rules in `semgrep --debug` output. (pa-2159)
- Taint: Fixed an issue where findings with the same sink would be identified as the same, and cause
  only one of them to be reported, even if they had different sources. (pa-2208)
- DeepSemgrep: When the "DeepSemgrep" setting is enabled in Semgrep App, `semgrep ci`
  will try to run the analysis using the DeepSemgrep engine. But if this engine was
  not installed, `semgrep ci` failed. Now `semgrep ci` will automatically try to
  install DeepSemgrep if it is not already present. Note that, if DeepSemgrep is
  already installed, `semgrep ci` does not attempt to upgrade it to a newer version. (pa-2226)
- CLI: Made the number of jobs when using `semgrep --deep` default to 1. (pa-2231)
- Autofix: If multiple autofixes are targeting an overlapping range, then one of them is picked arbitrarily to occur, to prevent autofixes which may produce incorrect code. (pa-2276)
- DeepSemgrep: Time data now outputs properly when running `semgrep --deep --time` (pa-2280)
- DeepSemgrep: Added a message which suggests that users update their version of DeepSemgrep, if the DeepSemgrep binary crashes (pa-2283)
- Yarn 2 parse failure on versions like @storybook/react-docgen-typescript-plugin@canary. This is only present as some kind special version range specifier and never appears as a concrete version. It would only be used to check if the dependency was in the manifest file, so we just parse the version as "canary"
  Yarn 2 parse failure on versions like @types/ol-ext@npm:@siedlerchr/types-ol-ext@3.0.6
  Yarn 2 parse failure on versions like resolve@patch:resolve@^1.1.7#~builtin<compat/resolve>. These are now just ignored, as they appear to always come with a non-patch version as well. (sc-406)

## [1.0.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v1.0.0) - 2022-12-01

### Added

- DeepSemgrep: If you have a Team tier account in Semgrep App, and you enable the
  _DeepSemgrep_ setting, then `semgrep ci` will automatically run the DeepSemgrep
  engine instead of the OSS engine on full scans (but not in PR scans). (pa-2226)

## [0.123.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.123.0) - 2022-11-29

### Added

- CLI: Added deep traces to `--dataflow-traces` (pa-2116)

### Changed

- Reachable Supply Chain findings will no longer block pull requests when using `semgrep ci`.
  Note that unreachable findings have been non-blocking already. (sca-nonblocking)

### Fixed

- Fix matching issue related to JS imports with multiple imported values (gh-5305)
- DeepSemgrep: Keep only the shortest trace originating from a taint source. This
  also prevents falling into infinite loops when inferring taint signatures for
  mutually recursive procedures. (pa-2224)
- taint-mode: Improved taint tracking for array-like accesses. Previously, if
  `x.a.b[i].c` got tainted, Semgrep would track `x.a.b` as tainted, and thus
  `x.a.b[i].d` would be incorrectly considered as tainted too. Now Semgrep will
  do the right thing and track `x.a.b[*].c` as tainted, and `x.a.b[i].d` will
  not be considered tainted. (pa-2225)
- Java: `private`, singly-assigned class variables now permit constant propagation (pa-2230)
- JS/TS: Allow dependencies to @Injectable and @Component classes in Angular JS to be visible outside the scope of the constructor. (pa-2233)
- Fix matching issue related to Python imports with multiple imported values (python-imports)
- Supply Chain findings from a yarn.lock lockfile were marked as 'transitive'
  when we couldn't find the matching package.json file.
  These findings will now be marked as having 'unknown' transitivity. (sc-425)
- Make `$X(...)` match `this()` and `super()`. (this-match)

## [0.122.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.122.0) - 2022-11-16

### Fixed

- DeepSemgrep: Added installation path for DeepSemgrep on M1 machines (pa-2153)
- Correctly handle optional name field in yaml1 lockfiles (parse_yaml)

## [0.121.2](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.121.2) - 2022-11-10

### Fixed

- Fix yaml excessive mapping captures (gh-5698)
- Rule syntax: Allow `pattern-not`, `pattern-inside`, and `pattern-not-inside` to take in arbitrary patterns (such as `patterns`, `pattern-either`, and friends) (pa-1723)
- Kotlin: Fixed bug where constructor invocation with a trailing comma would not parse (pa-1988)
- Constant propagation: Type casts and parenthesized expressions (in Go) can now be symbolically propagated. (pa-2054)
- CLI: Added a fix preventing findings from experimental rules being displayed.
  Experimental rules also now no longer run silently. (pa-2121)

## [0.121.1](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.121.1) - 2022-11-08

No significant changes.

## [0.121.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.121.0) - 2022-11-07

### Changed

- taint-mode: Semgrep can now track taint through l-values of the form `this.x`.
  It will also be more precise when tracking taint on l-values involving an
  array access, previously if `x.a[i]` was tainted, then `x` itself was tainted;
  now only `x.a` will be considered tainted. (pa-2086)

### Fixed

- JS: correctly parse exported function pattern (gh-6218)
- Terraform: Can now analyze constant-propagated values of variables with `metavariable-comparison` and friends (pa-2088)

## [0.120.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.120.0) - 2022-11-02

### Added

- Fail gracefully and print error message when running in unsupported Linux aarch64/arm64 environment (arm-fail)
- Added 'fingerprints' field to results in sarif output (gh-5729)
- Add dataflow traces as 'codeFlows' object in SARIF output (gh-6367)
- Fail immediately if semgrep tries to run a supply chain rule with an invalid version range specifier (ssc-fail-early)
- Added Supply Chain support for requirements.txt lockfiles (with requirement.in manifest files) and Yarn 2/3 lockfiles (ssc-yarn-req)

### Changed

- Change default behavior of CircleCI configurations. If a user manually sets their environment variables (i.e. SEMGREP_REPO_NAME, SEMGREP_REPO_URL, SEMGREP_BRANCH, SEMGREP_JOB_URL, SEMGREP_COMMIT), use it before falling back on autodetection. (app-2434)
- Change default behavior of Buildkite CI configurations. If a user manually sets their environment variables (i.e. SEMGREP_REPO_NAME, SEMGREP_REPO_URL, SEMGREP_BRANCH, SEMGREP_JOB_URL, SEMGREP_COMMIT), use it before falling back on autodetection. (app-2435)
- Change default behavior of bitbucket CI configurations. If a user manually sets their environment variables (i.e. SEMGREP_REPO_NAME, SEMGREP_REPO_URL, SEMGREP_BRANCH, SEMGREP_JOB_URL, SEMGREP_COMMIT), use it before falling back on autodetection. (app-2436)

### Fixed

- Handle unexpected exceptions when performing AST-based autofix. (autofix-exception)
- Fix an issue that could cause AST-based autofix to fail on autofixes containing statements. (autofix-statement-exception)
- Fix an issue preventing AST-based autofix from running in the presence of `focus-metavariable`. (focus-metavariable-autofix)
- Implement string literal metavariables in Python AST-based autofix (gh-3648)
- Go: parse correctly generic types from other packages (gh-5799)
- Fix parsing of dot access ellipsis in PHP patterns (e.g. `$x-> ... ->bar()`). (gh-6183)
- JS/TS: Allowed parsing of patterns using the optional chaining "?." syntax. (gh-6201)
- Dockerfile language: Add support for RUN options such as
  `RUN --mount=type=$TYPE,target=$TARGET ...`. (gh-6353)
- taint-mode: Fixed a bug in the experimental taint-labels feature that caused labels to be incorrectly applied to dot accesses. For instance, if a pattern-source that requires label A and adds label B matches a dot-access expression like x.a, the field a will get the label B even if it does not carry label A as required. (gh-6355)
- Use AST-based autofix when possible for JS autofixes. This is more likely to lead to correct output, especially for complicated fixes. (js-autofix)
- taint-mode: Fixed regression in 0.113.0, after field sensitivity support was added,
  that broke existing behavior when a prefix in a chain of dot-accesses such as
  `x.a.b` was specified as a source/sanitizer/sink. For example, if `x` had been
  previously tainted, then we encountered `sink(x.a.b)` where `x.a` matched a
  sanitizer, there was a finding reported because `x.a.b` was incorrectly considered
  tainted. (pa-1928)
- JS/TS: Fixed a parsing bug where special identifiers were parsed differently in patterns (pa-2030)
- Language server now appropriately applies regex fixes (vscode-regex)

## 0.119.0 - Skipped

Version 0.119.0 of Semgrep was intentionally skipped. Version 0.120.0 immediately follows version 0.118.0.

## [0.118.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.118.0) - 2022-10-19

### Added

- Taint mode will now track taint coming from the default values of function
  parameters. For example, given `def test(url = "http://example.com"):`,
  if `"http://example.com"` is a taint source (due to not using TLS), then
  `url` will be marked as tainted during the analysis of `test`. (gh-6298)
- taint-mode: Added two new rule `options` that help minimizing false positives.

  First one is `taint_assume_safe_indexes`, which makes Semgrep assume that an
  array-access expression is safe even if the index expression is tainted. Otherwise
  Semgrep assumes that e.g. `a[i]` is tainted if `i` is tainted, even if `a` is not.
  Enabling this option is recommended for high-signal rules, whereas disabling it
  may be preferred for audit rules. Currently, it is disabled by default for pure
  backwards compatibility reasons, but this may change in the near future after some
  evaluation.

  The other one is `taint_assume_safe_functions`, which makes Semgrep assume that
  function calls do _NOT_ propagate taint from their arguments to their output.
  Otherwise, Semgrep always assumes that functions may propagate taint. This is
  intended to replace _not conflicting_ sanitizers (added in v0.69.0) in the future.
  This option is still experimental and needs to be complemented by other changes
  to be made in future releases. (pa-1541)

### Changed

- Ignore the .npm/ directory by default in Semgrep scans (gh-6315)
- The `--scan-unknown-extensions` option is now set to false by default.
  This means that from now on `--skip-unknown-extensions` is the default.
  This is an important change that prevents many errors when using
  Semgrep in a pre-commit context or in CI. (pa-1932)

### Fixed

- Add autodetection for pull request numbers for Azure Pipelines. If SEMGREP_PR_ID is set, override the autodetection. (app-2083)
- Fixed an autofix regression that caused Semgrep to fail to replace metavariables in string literals, e.g. `foo("xyz $X")`. (autofix-string-metavar)

## [0.117.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.117.0) - 2022-10-12

### Added

- taint-mode: It is now possible to use `pattern-propagators` to propagate taint
  through higher-order iterators such as `forEach` in Java. For example:
  ````yaml
    pattern-propagators:
      - pattern: $X.forEach(($Y) -> ...)
        from: $X
        to: $Y
  ``` (gh-5971)
  ````

### Changed

- Change default behavior of Travis CI configurations. If a user manually sets their environment variables (i.e. SEMGREP_REPO_NAME, SEMGREP_REPO_URL, SEMGREP_BRANCH, SEMGREP_JOB_URL, SEMGREP_COMMIT, SEMGREP_PR_ID), use it before falling back on autodetection.

### Fixed

- Scala: Fixed a bug where generators would not parse if newlines were present, in certain cases (pa-1902)
- Fixed bug where nested dependencies in package-lock.json files were not detected (sc-247)
- Removed Gradle as a separate supply chain ecosystem. Maven rules now work on Gradle projects (sc-256)
- Lockfiles are no longer subject to size filtering during file targetting, so very large lockfiles can now generate unreachable findings (sc-293)

## [0.116.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.116.0) - 2022-10-06

### Added

- Added support for named arguments in taint tracking. This is only relevant for DeepSemgrep users. (pa-1886)

### Changed

- Change default behavior of Jenkins CI configurations. If a user manually sets their environment variables (i.e. SEMGREP_BRANCH, SEMGREP_JOB_URL, SEMGREP_COMMIT), use it before falling back on autodetection. (app-2432)
- Change default behavior of Azure Pipelines configurations. If a user manually sets their environment variables (i.e. SEMGREP_REPO_NAME, SEMGREP_REPO_URL, SEMGREP_BRANCH, SEMGREP_JOB_URL, SEMGREP_COMMIT), use it before falling back on autodetection. (app-2433)
- taint-mode: Removed experimental poor-man's support for wrapper functions around
  taint sources. This was an early experiment to make Semgrep inter-procedural, but
  it was later abandoned in favor of DeepSemgrep. (pa-1838)
- Disabled Bloom filter optimization by default, due to undesired interactions with
  constant and symbolic propagation, while it appears to not provide a net major
  performance benefit (nowadays). If you do notice a significant drop in performance
  after this change, please let us know. (pa-1927)
- Semgrep-core will no longer accept a rule file containing only one rule object,
  rules must be given in an array unde the `rules:` key. This change does not
  affect Semgrep CLI which never accepted that relaxed format. (pa-1931)
- Changed command line flag for supply chain scans from `--sca` to `--supply-chain`.
  Correspondinly changed `--config sca` to `--config supply-chain` (sca-ssc)

### Fixed

- Change default behavior of Jenkins CI configurations. If the SEMGREP_REPO_URL is set, use it. Otherwise, default to autodetection. (app-2406)
- fix: Ensure the docker image uses the latest base packages (docker)
- Fixed symbolic propagation of the `new` operator, that had been broken since
  version 0.98.0. You can again e.g. use the pattern `new A().foo()` to match
  `a.foo()`, with `a = new A()`. (gh-6161)
- Some crypto code like hashing algorithms can lead to a very large amount of
  symbolically propageted values, which previously caused Semgrep's Bloom filter
  to hang. (pa-1920)
- taint-mode: It is now possible for `this` or `this.x` to be a source of taint. (pa-1929)
- taint-mode: Fixed a bug that made Semgrep miss taint findings when the sink was
  located inside an `if` condition or a `throw` (aka `raise`) expression/statement. (pa-1933)
- Start to use the AST to render autofixes in some specific cases. As this is extended, autofix will become more correct and more powerful. (ast-autofix)
- Fixed a parser error in some package-lock.json files (sca-parse-error)

## [0.115.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.115.0) - 2022-09-27

### Added

- Adds support for a .semgrepconfig file. Users can add metadata (such as a list of tags) to the .semgrepconfig YAML file which will automatically be assigned to the project. (app-2112)
- Modify the CLI output to separate non-blocking and blocking findings and show a list of the blocking rules that fired. (app-2306)

### Changed

- generic mode: allow text input without human-readable indentation up to 500
  bytes. This value is subject to change. This relaxing is intended to
  facilitate testing where someone might copy-paste a long line without a
  trailing newline. Semgrep users should not expect files that are not
  human-readable to be processed in semgrep's generic mode, or in any mode for
  the matter. (gh-6071)
- Changed behavior for renamed files on diff scans (scans in which a baseline ref is provided).
  Semgrep will not show old issues to developers when they rename a file now. (gh-6157)

### Fixed

- Fixed nondeterministic failure of test_api test due to invalid settings file by
  configuring home directory to temporary directory. (app-2166)
- Change default behavior of Jenkins CI configurations. If the SEMGREP_REPO_NAME environment variable is set, use it. Otherwise, default autodetection. (app-2331)
- Dockerfile mode: Fix failure to match where image name and image alias should
  be the same. The problem was due to some names and identifiers being
  fragmented due to parsing rules and not pieced back together. (gh-5229)
- Scala: add support for ellipsis in match body (e.g., `$X match { ... }`) (gh-6131)
- Added a fix for a bug involving parsing of TS imports, where they were not allowed to appear as patterns to a rule. (pa-1910)

## [0.114.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.114.0) - 2022-09-19

### Added

- Add functionality to exclude rules by id passing it by cli flag --exclude-rule (cli-2530)
- Fixes https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/5686.
  You can now have multiple metavariables under `focus-metavariable`, which allows Semgrep to highlight the
  values matched by multiple metavariables more easily in certain circumstances.
  See the gist in the description of the original issue for an example. (gh-5686)

### Fixed

- C++: support ellipsis in right-hand-side of an assignment (gh-1923)
- Rust: support ellipsis in struct declarations (gh-3759)
- Fixed incorrect stripping of '\$' (literal dollar sign) in regexps used in the
  context of `metavariable-regex`. (gh-5987)
- Solidity: support constructor and modifier patterns (gh-6053)
- C#: support for metavariable ellipsis (e.g., `$...ARGS`) in arguments (gh-6065)
- Rust: support ellipsis inside module mody (gh-6066)
- Hold references to `NamedTemporaryFile` objects while their corresponding
  temporary files are still in use by the core runner. Failure to explicitly hold
  references to these objects on some Python implementations, such as PyPy,
  results in them sometimes being garbage-collected during processing. This,
  in turn, triggers removal of the temp files while they are still in use by
  the core runner or the worker subprocesses, resulting in various crashes and
  processing failures. (gh-6100)
- Swift: Fix parsing of statement ellipsis without a preceding semicolon (pa-1809)

## [0.113.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.113.0) - 2022-09-15

### Added

- Adds backwards-compatibility with older versions of semgrep-app. Only relevant for customers with on-prem versions of the app. (gh-6098)
- taint-mode: Experimental support for basic field-sensitive taint tracking.
  Semgrep can now track `x.a` and `x.b` separately, so that e.g. `x.a` can be
  tainted at the same time as `x.b` is clean, hence `sink(x.a)` would produce
  a finding but `sink(x.b)` would not. It is also possible for `x` to be tainted
  while `x.a` is clean. We expect this to have an net positive effect by reducing
  false positives. (pa-1278)
- Update the supply chain API to include information about the transitivity of matched dependencies (sca-199)

### Fixed

- Resolve imported classes when there are multiple chained classes.
  For example, if you `import world.Hello`, and create a
  `new Hello.internal_class()`, you can match that with
  `new world.Hello.internal_class()`. (gh-6001)
- Java: Correctly parse ellipsis in the body of top-level constructor patterns with privacy modifiers (e.g. public Foo() { ... }) (gh-6051)
- `semgrep --test` now fails when encountering a parsing error in target code. (gh-6068)
- Allowed metavariable-comparison to make use of the `not in` operator. (gh-6072)
- Fixed parsing of Rust impl definitions (gh-6078)
- Fixed a `TypeError: unbound method set.intersection() needs an argument` crash
  that occurred when all of a scan's rules were multilang (`regex` or `generic`). (gh-6093)

## [0.112.1](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.112.1) - 2022-09-08

### Fixed

- Fixed a regression introduced with the previous release, involving a bug with `pattern-inside`. (gh-6059)

## [0.112.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.112.0) - 2022-09-07

### Added

- JS/TS: Allow standalone switch cases as patterns (e.g. `case 5: ...`) (pa-1788)
- Symbolic propagation: Added propagation of all variables which are assigned to a single time. This will affect global variables and class attributes, in particular. (pa-1821)

### Changed

- Use new semgrep-app endpoint that combines the two POST requests to upload findings and ignored findings into one POST request. (app-1446)

### Fixed

- Update git url parser to support optional "org" after hostname. Example: https://some.enterprise.scm/myorg/owner/repo. (app-2202)
- Fix an incorrect autofix application when the fix includes Python f strings (gh-2995)
- Fix matching and autofix with bare tuples in Python array accesses (e.g. x[1, 2]) (gh-3387)
- Ruby: A pattern of the form `/.../` can now match any regexp, including regexp templates such as `/hello #{name}/`. (gh-5147)
- Fix parsing of Java constructors with privacy modifiers as patterns, e.g. the pattern `public Foo() { }` (gh-5558)
- Java: correctly parse class literal patterns (gh-6002)
- Solidity: correctly parse try statements (gh-6031)
- Python: Now support `match` statements (pa-1739)
- Fixed bug in constant propagation that caused incorrect constants to be inferred
  in the presence of subtraction. (pa-1846)

## [0.111.1](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.111.1) - 2022-08-23

### Changed

- Previously, the following error message appears when metrics are not uploaded within the set timeout timeframe:

  Error in send: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='metrics.semgrep.dev', port=443): Read timed out. (read timeout=3)

  As this causes users confusion when running the CLI, the log level of the message is reduced to appear for development and debugging purposes only. Note that metrics are still successfully uploaded, but the success status is not sent in time for the curent timeout set. (app-1398)

### Fixed

- taint-mode: Fixed the translation from Generic to IL for expressions like
  `"some string".concat(x)`. Previously, when `x` was tainted, the `concat`
  expression was not recognized as tainted and this caused false negatives. (pa-1787)

## [0.111.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.111.0) - 2022-08-22

### Added

- Introduced experimental support for Swift (gh-2232)
- Add configuration options for using a tree-sitter library installed anywhere
  on the system. (gh-5944)
- Updated the supply chain finding API:
  - The API is now typed and defined entirely in semgrep_output_v0.atd
  - Supply chain findings now have only one dependency match, not a list, and only one resolved url
  - Supply chain findings now have a field called reachable and reachability_rule,
    which indicate if the finding is reachable, and whether or not it was generated
    by a reachability rule (rule that had a semgrep pattern)
  - Supply chain findings now include a schema version
  - The complete finding information sent to semgrep app now includes a mapping from lockfile
    paths to the number of dependencies that were present in that lockfile (sca-197)

### Fixed

- When a YAML rule file had a string that contained an ISO timestamp, that would be parsed as a datetime object, which would then be rejected by Semgrep's rule schema validator. This is now fixed by keeping strings that contain an ISO timestamp as strings. (app-2157)
- When parsing PHP with tree-sitter, parse `$this` similar to pfff, as an IdSpecial. This makes it possible to match `$this` when the pattern is parsed with pfff and the program with tree-sitter. (gh-5594)
- Parse die() as exit() in tree-sitter PHP. This makes pfff and tree-sitter parse die() in the same way. (gh-5880)
- All: Applied a fix so that qualified identifiers can unify with metavariables. Notably, this
  affected Python decorators, among others. (pa-1700)
- Fixed a regression in DeepSemgrep after the experimental taint labels feature
  was introduced in 0.106.0. This prevented DeepSemgrep from reporting taint
  findings when e.g. the sink was wrapped by another function. (pa-1750)
- Fixed metavariable unification in JSON when one of the patterns is a single field. (pa-1763)
- Changed symbolic propagation such that "redundant" matches are no
  longer reported as findings. For instance:

  ```py
  def foo():
    x = g(5)
    f(x)
  ```

  If we are looking for the pattern `g(5)`, we should not match on line 3,
  since we will match on line 2 anyways, and this is just repeating information that
  we already know.

  This patch changes it so that we do not match on line 3 anymore. (pa-1772)

- Semgrep now passes -j to DeepSemgrep engine so --deep became noticeably faster. (pa-1776)
- taint-mode: Due to a mistake in the instantiation of a visitor, named function
  definitions were being analyzed twice! This is now fixed and you may observe
  significant speed ups in some cases. (pa-1778)
- Extract mode: fixed a possible exception in normal usage introduced due to
  changes in handling of search/taint rules. (pa-1786)
- Changed the fail-open message body (pm-194)

### Infra/Release Changes

- GHA Runner `macos-12` is unreliable and has begun failing without
  a clear explanation as to why: this downgrades to `macos-11`,
  since 10.15 is to be depracted ~10 from now. (devop-609)
- Keep the tree-sitter library inside a local folder rather than requiring
  a global installation. (gh-2956)

## [0.110.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.110.0) - 2022-08-15

### Changed

- Parse several built-in PHP functions in the same way in pfff and tree-sitter. This makes it possible to match exit, eval, empty and isset, even if the pattern is parsed with pfff and the PHP file with tree-sitter. (gh-5382)
- Use new semgrep-app endpoints that are pure GET with no side-effects and pure POST (app-2001)

### Fixed

- Skip fail-open for exit code 1 (app-2073)

## [0.109.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.109.0) - 2022-08-11

### Changed

- `semgrep ci` now defaults to fail open and will always exit with exit code 0, which is equivalent to passing `--suppress-errors`.
  To disable this behavior, you can pass `--no-suppress-errors` and semgrep will behave as it did previously, surfacing any exit codes that may result. (app-1951)

### Fixed

- taint-mode: Taint traces (`--dataflow-traces`) should no longer report "strange"
  intermediate variables when there are record accesses involved. This happened e.g.
  if `foo` was a tainted record and the code accessed some of its fields as in
  `foo.bar.baz`. This was related to the use of auxiliary variables in the Dataflow IL.
  These variables got tainted, but they had real tokens attached corresponding to the
  dot `.` operator. Now we do not include these variables in the taint trace. (pa-1672)

### Infra/Release Changes

- GHA runner-image `macos-10.15` is deprecated and will be unsupported by 30AUG2022. We've tested and can upgrade to `macos-12` to avoid issues with brownouts or end of support. (devop-586)

## [0.108.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.108.0) - 2022-08-03

### Added

- Metrics now include language-aggregated parse rates (files, bytes). The purpose
  of this is to help drive parsing improvements more intelligently. See
  [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) for more details. (pa-1678)

### Changed

- Updated SCA finding generation so that the following hold:
  - One SCA finding per vulnerable dependency. If one rule matches multiple dependencies in one lockfile,
    that will produce multiple findings. This still needs to be codified in the typed interface
  - No findings in files that were not targeted. If foo.py depends on Pipfile.lock,
    and foo.py is targeted but Pipfile.lock is not, then we can produce reachable findings
    in foo.py but not non-reachable findings in Pipfile.lock. If Pipfile.lock is included in
    our targets then we can produce non-reachable findings inside of it
  - No massive single scan for lockfiles. (sca-127)

### Fixed

- Fixed issue when scan fails due to pending changes in submodule. (cli-272)
- Semgrep CI now accepts more formats of git url for metadata provided to semgrep.dev and lets the user provide a fallback for repo name (SEMGREP_REPO_NAME) and repo url (SEMGREP_REPO_URL) if they are undefined by CI. (cli-280)
- Fixed a crash that occurred when reporting results when join mode and taint mode were used together (gh-5839)
- JS: Allowed decorators to appear in Semgrep patterns for class methods and fields. (pa-1677)
- Quick fix for a regression introduced in 0.107.0 (presumably by taint labels)
  that could cause some taint rules to crash Semgrep with:

      Invalid_argument "output_value: abstract value (Custom)" (pa-1724)

- Increase timeout for network calls to semgrep.dev from 30s to 60s (timeout-1)

## [0.107.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.107.0) - 2022-07-29

### Added

- Added metadata in App-connected scans to report extensions of files that do not match the language of any enabled rules in order to enable more effective language prioritization while developing new rules. (app-1354)
- Support fail-open in CI: adds --suppress-errors/--no-suppress-errors (defaults to --no-suppress-errors) (cli-254)
- New language Elixir with experimental support. (gh-3698)
- Kotlin: support for ellipsis in field access (e.g., `obj. ... .bar()`) (gh-5819)
- Changed `semgrep-core` so that it can now be run with `-rules` on `.yaml` files which do not have a top-level `rules: ...` key. This means you can now copy paste from the playground editor directly into a `.yaml` file for use with `semgrep-core`. (implicit-rules-sc-core)
- Add experimental support for _taint labels_, that is the ability to attach labels to
  different kinds of taint. Both sources and sinks can retrict what labels are present
  in the data that passes through them in order to apply. This allows to write more
  complex taint rules that previously required ugly workarounds. Taint labels are also
  useful for writing certain classes of typestate analyses (e.g., check that a file
  descriptor is not used after being closed). (pa-1362)
- Introduced the `--dataflow-traces` flag, which directs the Semgrep CLI to explain how non-local values lead to a finding. Currently, this only applies to taint mode findings and it will trace the path from the taint source to the taint sink. (pa-1599)

### Changed

- Made breaking changes to the dataflow_trace JSON output to make it more easily consumable by the App. Added content for taint_source and intermediate_vars, and collapsed the multile taint_source locations into one. (dataflow-trace-json)
- Removed the unique_id field from the semgrep (and semgrep-core) JSON output
  for metavariables. (unique-id-json)

### Fixed

- Fixed format of repository urls so links to findings can be properly displayed on semgrep.dev (cli-278)
- Scala: Allow metavariables in `import` patterns (gh-5219)
- Rules reported for LSP metrics now are hashed before sending (lsp-metrixs)
- `-filter_irrelevant_rules` was incorrectly skipping files when the PCRE engine threw
  an error, while trying to match a regex that determines whether a rule is relevant
  for a file. This has been fixed so that, in case of a PCRE error, we assume that the
  rule could be relevant and we do run it on the file. (pa-1635)

## [0.106.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.106.0) - 2022-07-21

### Changed

- `metavariable-comparison`: The `metavariable` field is now optional, except
  if `strip: true`. When `strip: false` (the default) the `metavaraible` field
  has no use so it was pointless to require it. (metavariable-comparison-metavariable)
- `metavariable-comparison` now also works on metavariables that cannot be evaluated
  to simple literals. In such cases, we take the string representation of the code
  bound by the metavariable. The way to access this string representation is via
  `str($MVAR)`. For example:

  ```
  - metavariable-comparison:
      metavariable: $X
      comparison: str($X) == str($Y)
  ```

  Here `$X` and `$Y` may bind to two different code variables, and we check whether
  these two code variables have the same name (e.g. two different variables but both
  named `x`). (pa-1659)

- When running an SCA scan with `semgrep ci --sca`,
  SCA findings will no longer be considered blocking if they are unreachable. (sca-128)

### Fixed

- Fixed a regression in name resolution that occurred with metavariable patterns (gh-5690)
- Rust: Fixed a bug with matching for scoped identifiers

  Basically, scoped identifiers were only looking at the last identifier. So something like `A::B::C` would result in something like `C`. (gh-5717)

## [0.105.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.105.0) - 2022-07-20

### Added

- _Experimental_ LSP support for: metavariable inlay hints, hot reloading, App integation, scan commands, and much much more (cli-235)
- Added a concatenation reduction for extract mode, so that disjoint snippets
  within a file can be treated as one unified file. (extract-reductions)
- Extract mode: taint trace positions are now updated to correspond to the source
  file. (extract-taint-traces)
- Extract mode: generic is now permitted as a `languages` value (pa-1648)
- Added handling for EXPERIMENT severity to allow the ability to test rules as experiments. (rules-680)

### Changed

- Do not store time or skipped targets output unless requested. This reduces memory consumption significantly in large repos (pa-1618)
- Reduce memory consumption of semgrep by passing the targets in a more condensed
  structure. Previously, we told semgrep which rules to run on which target by
  listing out all the rule_ids each target should run. Now, we have a separate
  rule_id list and for each target we only ilst the rule_id indices. On large
  repos, particularly when run with multiple processes, this has a significant
  impact. (pa-1618-2)

### Fixed

- C#: Improved error message when function parameters are declared with `var` (gh-5068)
- Scala/others: Added a fix allowing percolation of name information from class parameters

  For example, classes which take in arguments like the following in Scala:

  ```scala
  class ExampleClass(val x: TypeName) {
  }
  ```

  do not properly enter the context. So in our analysis, we would not know that the identifier
  `x` has type `TypeName`, within the body of `ExampleClass`. (gh-5506)

- Fixed the logged message describing the endpoint where rules are fetched from when SEMGREP_URL is set (gh-5753)
- Fixed what data was used for indexing match results to used match based id data (index)

## [0.104.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.104.0) - 2022-07-13

### Added

- `semgrep ci` will now not block builds on triage ignored issues (cli-162)
- Add support to cli/scripts/compare.py for podman environments (compare-script-podman)
- A new experimental 'extract' mode. This mode runs a Semgrep rule on a codebase
  and "extracts" code from matches, treating it as a different language. This
  allows users to supplement an existing set of rules, e.g., for JavaScript, by
  writing additional rules to find JavaScript in non-JavaScript files, e.g.,
  JavaScript contained in HTML or template files. While this is somewhat possible
  with metavariable-pattern, this reduces the work from an M \* N problem to an M \+ N one. (gh-4478)
- Added taint traces as part of Semgrep's JSON output. This helps explain how the sink became tainted. (pa-1271)

### Changed

- Metavariable-pattern now uses the same metavariable context as its parent. This will potentially
  cause breaking changes for rules that reuse metavariables in the pattern. For example, consider
  the following formula:

  ```
  - patterns:
     - pattern-either:
         - pattern-inside: $OBJ.output($RESP)
     - pattern: $RESP
     - metavariable-pattern:
         metavariable: $RESP
         pattern: `...{ $OBJ }...`
  ```

  Previously, the `$OBJ` in the metavariable-pattern would be a new metavariable. The formula would
  behave the same if that `$OBJ` was `$A` instead. Now, `$OBJ` will try to unify with the value bound
  by `$OBJ` in the pattern-inside. (gh-5060)

- The semgrep test output used to produce expected lines and reported lines which is difficult to read and interpret. This change introduces missed lines and incorrect lines to make it easier for the users to pinpoint the differences in output. (gh-5600)
- Separator lines are no longer drawn between findings that have no source code snippet. (sca-ui)
- Using ellipses in XML/HTML elements is now more permissive of whitespace.
  Previously, in order to have a element with an ellipsis no leading/trailing
  whitespace was permitted in the element contents, i.e., `<tag>...</tag>` was
  the only permitted form. Now, leading or trailing whitespace is ignored when
  the substantive content of the element is only an ellipsis. (xml-permissive-ellipsis)

### Fixed

- Semgrep App's links to repositories, code snippets, and pull requests are no longer broken for projects that run Semgrep in Circle CI, Bitbucket, and Buildkite. (cli-267)
- When running Semgrep via Docker for Mac,
  all volume-mounted files were considered executable and thus a candidate for scanning Bash code,
  making target collection take longer, and sometimes targeting more files than intended.
  This was fixed by using `os.stat` instead of `os.access` to determine if a file is executable. (gh-5560)
- Semgrep used to crash when trying to print findings that match only whitespace, such as when a rule disallows two newlines at the end of a file. This crash is now fixed. (gh-5633)
- Memory usage improvement: don't save skipped targets when `--debug` isn't passed
  since it isn't read unless `--debug` is used (pa-1618)

### Infra/Release Changes

- Updated the GH Release creation to publish the release instead of drafting one - this avoids a failure of validation jobs on release. (cli-243)
- Using some building blocks from release, set up a workflow to test `semgrep ci` e2e. (cli-253)
- Updated our changelog management system to `towncrier` to avoid merge conflicts in changelog on release (cli-77)
- The opening of PRs in other repos is automated with semgrep release - there is still a manual review required to build confidence. (cli-84)

## Unreleased

## [0.103.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.103.0) - 2022-07-05

### Added

- Expression statement patterns (e.g. `foo();`) used to also match when
  they were a bit deeper in the expression (e.g., `x = foo();`).
  This can now be disabled via rule `options:`
  with `implicit_deep_exprstmt: false` (#5472)
- The timeout for git commands Semgrep runs is now configurable by setting the
  `SEMGREP_GIT_COMMAND_TIMEOUT` environment variable.
  The unit used is seconds. The default value is 300.

### Fixed

- Error messages in JSON output used to contain ANSI color codes,
  this was fixed so they are now uncolored (and readable!) plain text.
- Fixed config parsing bug to cut CI scan speeds down significantly

## [0.102.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.102.0) - 2022-06-30

### Added

- Scala: ellipsis are now allowed in for loop headers, so you can write patterns
  like `for (...; $X <- $Y if $COND; ...) { ... }` to match nested for loops. (#5650)
- The `SEMGREP_GHA_MIN_FETCH_DEPTH` environment variable which lets you set how many
  commits `semgrep ci` fetches from the remote at the minimum when calculating the merge-base in GitHub Actions.
  Having more commits available helps Semgrep determine what changes came from the current pull request,
  fixing issues where Semgrep would report findings that weren't touched in a given pull request.
  This value is set to 0 by default (#5664)

### Fixed

- taint-mode: In some scenarios some statements were not being included in the
  CFG used by taint tracking, and as a result some expected findings were not being
  reported (i.e. false negatives). This affected mainly languages like Scala where
  traditional control-flow constructs are expressions rather than statements (or,
  seen in a different way, every statement returns a value). (#5652)
- Yaml: location information is fixed for unicode characters (#5660)

### Changed

- `--verbose` no longer toggles the display of timing information, use
  `--verbose --time` to display this information.
- Change timeout for git operations from 100s to 500s

## [0.101.1](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.101.1) - 2022-06-28

### Fixed

- `semgrep ci`: CI runs in GitHub Actions failed to checkout the commit assoociated with the head branch, and is fixed here.

## [0.101.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.101.0) - 2022-06-27

### Added

- Bash: Support for subshell syntax i.e. commands in parentheses (#5629)

### Changed

### Fixed

- `semgrep ci`: CI runs were failing to checkout the PR head in GitHub Actions, which is
  corrected here.
- TS: fixed the parsing of type predicates and typeof queries
- Deep expression matching now works on HTML in JavaScript
- taint-mode: Taint propagation via `pattern-propagators` now works correclty when the
  `from` or `to` metavariables match a function call. For example, given
  `sqlBuilder.append(page.getOrderBy())`, we can now propagate taint from
  `page.getOrderBy()` to `sqlBuilder`.
- Will no longer print "files were not tracked by git" if not in a git repo
- Will no longer print "Some files were skipped" if no files were skipped
- Fixed bug where semgrep would crash in nonexistent directory (#4785)
- taint-mode: Correctly propagate taint in for-each loops with typed iteration
  variables (as in Java or C#). If the iterator object is tainted, that taint will
  now be propagated to the iteration variable. This should fix some false negatives
  (i.e., findings not being reported) in the presence of for-each loops. (#5590)

## [0.100.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.100.0) - 2022-06-22

## Added

- taint-mode: New experimental `pattern-propagators` feature that allows to specify
  arbitrary patterns for the propagation of taint by side-effect. In particular,
  this allows to specify how taint propagates through side-effectful function calls.
  For example, you can specify that when tainted data is added to an array then the
  array itself becomes tainted. (#4509)

### Changed

- `--config auto` no longer sends the name of the repository being scanned to the Semgrep Registry.
  As of June 21st, this data is not recorded by the Semgrep Registry backend, even if an old Semgrep version sends it.
  Also as of June 21st, none of the previously collected repository names are retained by the Semgrep team;
  any historical data has been wiped.
- Gitlab SAST output is now v14.1.2 compliant
- Removed the following deprecated `semgrep scan` options:
  `--json-stats`, `--json-time`, `--debugging-json`, `--save-test-output-tar`, `--synthesize-patterns`,
  `--generate-config/-g`, `--dangerously-allow-arbitrary-code-execution-from-rules`,
  and `--apply` (which was an easter egg for job applications, not the same as `--autofix`)
- PHP: switch to GA maturity! Thanks a lot to Sjoerd Langkemper for most of the
  heavy work

### Fixed

- Inline join mode rules can now run taint-mode rules
- Python: correctly handle `with` context expressions where the value is not
  bound (#5513)
- Solidity: update to a more recent tree-sitter-solidity to fix certain parsing
  errors (#4957)

## 0.99.0 - Skipped

Version 0.99.0 of Semgrep was intentionally skipped. Version 0.100.0 immediately follows version 0.98.0.

## [0.98.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.98.0) - 2022-06-15

### Added

- New language R with experimental support (#2360)
  Thanks to Zythosec for some contributions.
- Autodetection of CI env now supports Azure Pipelines, Bitbucket, Buildkite, Circle CI, Jenkins,
  and Travis CI in addition to GitHub and GitLab
- You can now disable version checks with an environment variable by setting
  `SEMGREP_ENABLE_VERSION_CHECK=0`
- Dataflow: spread operators in record expressions (e.g. `{...foo}`) are now translated into the Dataflow IL
- An experimental LSP daemon mode for semgrep. Try it with `semgrep lsp --config auto`!

### Changed

- Rules are now downloaded from the Semgrep Registry in JSON format instead of YAML.
  This speeds up rule parsing in the Semgrep CLI,
  making a `semgrep --config auto` run on the semgrep Python package in 14s instead of 16s.

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where `--disable-version-check` would still send a request
  when a scan resulted in zero findings.
- Fixed a regression in 0.97 where the Docker image's working directory changed from `/src` without notice.
  This also could cause permission issues when running the image.
- Go: single pattern field can now match toplevel fields in a composite
  literal (#5452)
- PHP: metavariable-pattern: works again when used with language: php (#5443)
- PHP: booleans are propagated by constant propagation (#5509)
- PHP: named arguments work in patterns (#5508)
- Fixed a non-deterministic crash when matching a large number of regexes (#5277)
- Fixed issue when running in GithubActions that caused semgrep to report on
  files not changed in the PR (#5453)
- JS/TS: `$X()` no longer matches `new Foo()`, for consistency with other languages (#5510)
- JS/TS: Typed metavariables now match constructor calls (e.g. `($X: C)` matches `new C()`. (#5540)

## [0.97.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.97.0) - 2022-06-08

### Added

- Dataflow: XML elements (e.g. JSX elements) have now a basic translation to the
  Dataflow IL, meaning that dataflow analysis (constant propagation, taint tracking)
  can now operate inside these elements (#5115)
- Java: you can now use a metavariable in a package directive (#5420),
  for example, `package $X`, which is useful to bind the package
  name and use it in the error message.

### Fixed

- The output of `semgrep ci` should be clear it is exiting with error code 0
  when there are findings but none of them being blockers
- Java: support for Sealed classes and Text Blocks via tree-sitter-java
  (#3787, #4644)
- The JUnit XML output should serialize the failure messages as a single
  string instead of a python list of strings.
- Typescript: update to latest tree-sitter-typescript, with support
  for 'abstract' modifier in more places
- Scala: stop parsing parenthesized expressions as unary tuples
- `yarn.lock` files with no depenencies, and with dependencies that lack URLs, now parse
- Scala: fixed bug where typed patterns inside classes caused an exception during name resolution
- metavariable-regex: patterns are now unanchored as specified by the
  documentation (#4807)
- When a logged in CI scan encounters a Git failure,
  we now print a helpful error message instead of a traceback.

## [0.96.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.96.0) - 2022-06-03

### Added

- Generic mode: new option `generic_ellipsis_max_span` for controlling
  how many lines an ellipsis can match (#5211)
- Generic mode: new option `generic_comment_style` for ignoring
  comments that follow the specified syntax (C style, C++ style, or
  Shell style) (#3428)
- Metrics now include a list of features used during an execution.
  Examples of such features are: languages scanned, CLI options passed, keys used in rules,
  or certain code paths reached, such as using an `:include` instruction in
  a `.semgrepignore` file.
  These strings will NOT include user data or specific settings. As an example,
  with `semgrep scan --output=secret.txt` we might send `"option/output"` but
  will NOT send `"option/output=secret.txt"`.

### Changed

- The output summarizing a scan's results has been simplified.

## [0.95.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.95.0) - 2022-06-02

### Added

- Sarif output format now includes `fixes` section
- `--test` flag will now seach for code files with `.fixed` suffix and use
  these to test the behaviour of autofixes of the rules.
- Rust: added support for method chaining patterns.
- `r2c-internal-project-depends-on`: support for poetry and gradle lockfiles
- M1 Mac support added to PyPi
- Accept `SEMGREP_BASELINE_REF` as alias for `SEMGREP_BASELINE_COMMIT`
- `r2c-internal-project-depends-on`:
  - pretty printing for SCA results
  - support for poetry and gradle lockfiles
- taint-mode: Taint tracking will now analyze lambdas in their surrounding context.
  Previously, if a variable became tainted outside a lambda, and this variable was
  used inside the lambda causing the taint to reach a sink, this was not being
  detected because any nested lambdas were "opaque" to the analysis. (Taint tracking
  looked at lambdas but as isolated functions.) Now lambas are simply analyzed as if
  they were statement blocks. However, taint tracking still does not follow the flow
  of taint through the lambda's arguments!
- Metrics now include an anonymous Event ID. This is an ID generated at send-time
  and will be used to de-duplicate events that potentially get duplicated during transmission.
- Metrics now include an anonymous User ID. This ID is stored in the ~/.semgrep/settings.yml file. If the ID disappears, the next run will generate a new one randomly. See the [Anonymous User ID in PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md#anonymous-user-id) for more details.

### Fixed

- M1 Mac installed via pip now links tree-sitter properly
- Restore `--sca`

### Changed

- The `ci` CLI command will now include ignored matches in output formats
  that dictate they should always be included
- Previously, you could use `$X` in a message to interpolate the variable captured
  by a metavariable named `$X`, but there was no way to access the underlying value.
  However, sometimes that value is more important than the captured variable.
  Now you can use the syntax `value($X)` to interpolate the underlying
  propagated value if it exists (if not, it will just use the variable name).

  Example:

  Take a target file that looks like

  ```py
  x = 42
  log(x)
  ```

  Now take a rule to find that log command:

  ```yaml
  - id: example_log
    message: Logged $SECRET: value($SECRET)
    pattern: log(42)
    languages: [python]
  ```

  Before, this would have given you the message `Logged x: value(x)`. Now, it
  will give the message `Logged x: 42`.

- A parameter pattern without a default value can now match a parameter
  with a default value (#5021)

### Fixed

- Numerous improvements to PHP parsing by switching to tree-sitter-php
  to parse PHP target code. Huge shoutout to Sjoerd Langkemper for most
  of the heavy lifting work
  (#3941, #2648, #2650, #3590, #3588, #3587, #3576, #3848, #3978, #4589)
- TS: support number and boolean typed metavariables (#5350)
- When a rule from the registry fails to parse, suggest user upgrade to
  latest version of semgrep
- Scala: correctly handle `return` for taint analysis (#4975)
- PHP: correctly handle namespace use declarations when they don't rename
  the imported name (#3964)
- Constant propagation is now faster and memory efficient when analyzing
  large functions with lots of variables.

## [0.94.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.94.0) - 2022-05-25

### Added

- `metavariable-regex` now supports an optional `constant-propagation` key.
  When this is set to `true`, information learned from constant propagation
  will be used when matching the metavariable against the regex. By default
  it is set to `false`
- Dockerfile: constant propagation now works on variables declared with `ENV`
- `shouldafound` - False Negative reporting via the CLI

### Changed

- taint-mode: Let's say that e.g. `taint(x)` makes `x` tainted by side-effect.
  Previously, we had to rely on a trick that declared that _any_ occurrence of
  `x` inside `taint(x); ...` was as taint source. If `x` was overwritten with
  safe data, this was not recognized by the taint engine. Also, if `taint(x)`
  occurred inside e.g. an `if` block, any occurrence of `x` outside that block
  was not considered tainted. Now, if you specify that the code variable itself
  is a taint source (using `focus-metavariable`), the taint engine will handle
  this as expected, and it will not suffer from the aforementioned limitations.
  We believe that this change should not break existing taint rules, but please
  report any regressions that you may find.
- taint-mode: Let's say that e.g. `sanitize(x)` sanitizes `x` by side-effect.
  Previously, we had to rely on a trick that declared that _any_ occurrence of
  `x` inside `sanitize(x); ...` was sanitized. If `x` later overwritten with
  tainted data, the taint engine would still regard `x` as safe. Now, if you
  specify that the code variable itself is sanitized (using `focus-metavariable`),
  the taint engine will handle this as expected and it will not suffer from such
  limitation. We believe that this change should not break existing taint rules,
  but please report any regressions that you may find.
- The dot access ellipsis now matches field accesses in addition to method
  calls.
- pattern-regex, pattern-not-regex, metavariable-regex: `^` and `$`
  now match at the beginning and end of each line, respectively,
  rather than previously just at the beginning and end of the input
  file. This corresponds to PCRE's multiline mode. To get the old
  behavior back, use `\A` instead of '^' and `\Z` instead of `$`. See
  the [PCRE
  manual](https://www.pcre.org/original/doc/html/pcrepattern.html#smallassertions)
  for details.
- Made error message for resource exhausion (exit code -11/-9) more actionable
- Made error message for rules with patterns missing positive terms
  more actionable (#5234)
- In this version, we have made several performance improvements
  to the code that surrounds our source parsing and matching core.
  This includes file targeting, rule fetching, and similar parts of the codebase.
  Running `semgrep scan --config auto` on the semgrep repo itself
  went from 50-54 seconds to 28-30 seconds.
  - As part of these changes, we removed `:include .gitignore` and `.git/`
    from the default `.semgrepignore` patterns.
    This should not cause any difference in which files are targeted
    as other parts of Semgrep ignore these files already.
  - A full breakdown of our performance updates,
    including some upcoming ones,
    can be found here https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/5257#issuecomment-1133395694
- If a metrics event request times out, we no longer retry the request.
  This avoids Semgrep waiting 10-20 seconds before exiting if these requests are slow.
- The metrics collection timeout has been raised from 2 seconds to 3 seconds.

### Fixed

- TS: support for template literal types after upgrading to a more recent
  tree-sitter-typescript (Oct 2021)
- TS: support for `override` keyword (#4220, #4798)
- TS: better ASI (#4459) and accept code like `(null)(foo)` (#4468)
- TS: parse correctly private properties (#5162)
- Go: Support for ellipsis in multiple return values
  (e.g., `func foo() (..., error, ...) {}`) (#4896)
- semgrep-core: you can use again rules stored in JSON instead of YAML (#5268)
- Python: adds support for parentheses around `with` context expressions
  (e.g., `with (open(x) as a, open(y) as b): pass`) (#5092)
- C++: we now parse correctly const declarations (#5300)

## [0.93.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.93.0) - 2022-05-17

### Changed

- Files where only some part of the code had to be skipped due to a parse failure
  will now be listed as "partially scanned" in the end-of-scan skip report.
- Licensing: The ocaml-tree-sitter-core component is now distributed
  under the terms of the LGPL 2.1, rather than previously GPL 3.
- A new field was added to metrics collection: isAuthenticated.
  This is a boolean flag which is true if you ran semgrep login.

### Fixed

- `semgrep ci` used to incorrectly report the base branch as a CI job's branch
  when running on a `pull_request_target` event in GitHub Actions.
  By fixing this, Semgrep App can now track issue status history with `on: pull_request_target` jobs.
- Metrics events were missing timestamps even though `PRIVACY.md` had already documented a timestamp field.

## [0.92.1](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.92.1) - 2022-05-13

### Added

- Datafow: The dataflow engine now handles if-then-else expressions as in OCaml,
  Ruby, etc. Previously it only handled if-then-else statements. (#4965)

### Fixed

- Kotlin: support for ellispis in class parameters, e.g.. `class Foo(...) {}` (#5180)
- JS/TS: allow ellipsis in binding_pattern (e.g., in arrow parameters) (#5230)
- JS/TS: allow ellipsis in imports (e.g., `import {..., Foo, ...} from 'Bar'`) (#5012)
- `fixed_lines` is once again included in JSON output when running with `--autofix --dryrun`

## [0.92.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.92.0) - 2022-05-11

### Added

- The JSON output of `semgrep scan` is now fully specified using
  ATD (https://atd.readthedocs.io/) and jsonschema (https://json-schema.org/).
  See the semgrep-interfaces submodule under interfaces/
  (e.g., interfaces/semgrep-interfaces/Semgrep_output_v0.atd for the ATD spec)
- The JSON output of `semgrep scan` now contains a "version": field with the
  version of Semgrep used to generate the match results.
- taint-mode: Previously, to declare a function parameteter as a taint source,
  we had to rely on a trick that declared that _any_ occurence of the parameter
  was a taint source. If the parameter was overwritten with safe data, this was
  not recognized by the taint engine. Now, `focus-metavariable` can be used to
  precisely specify that a function parameter is a source of taint, and the taint
  engine will handle this as expected.
- taint-mode: Add basic support for object destructuring in languages such as
  Javascript. For example, given `let {x} = E`, Semgrep will now infer that `x`
  is tainted if `E` is tainted.

### Fixed

- OCaml: Parenthesis in autofixed code will no longer leave dangling closing-paren.
  Thanks to Elliott Cable for his contribution (#5087)
- When running the Semgrep Docker image, we now mark all directories as safe for use by Git,
  which prevents a crash when the current user does not own the source code directory.
- C++: Ellipsis are now allowed in for loop header (#5164)
- Java: typed metavariables now leverages the type of foreach variables (#5181)

## [0.91.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.91.0) - 2022-05-03

### Added

- `--core-opts` flag to send options to semgrep-core. For internal use:
  no guarantees made for semgrep-core options (#5111)

### Changed

- `semgrep ci` prints out all findings instead of hiding nonblocking findings (#5116)

## [0.90.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.90.0) - 2022-04-26

### Added

- Users can access the propagated value of a metavariable in the JSON output
  in the extra field
- Join mode now supports inline rules via the `rules:` key underneath the `join:` key.
- Added vendor.name field in gitlab sast output (#5077)

### Changed

- YAML parsing is more tolerant of `{}` appearing when it expects a scalar,
  allowing extensions of YAML that use `{}` to be parsed (#4849)
- Turn off optimization that trades off memory for performance because
  the effect is minor (with current parameters)

### Fixed

- Keep only latest run logs in last.log file (#5070)
- r2c-internal-project-depends-on:
  - Lockfiles that fail to parse will not crash semgrep
  - cargo.lock and Pipfile.lock dependencies that don't specify hashes now parse
  - go.sum files with a trailing newline now parse

## [0.89.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.89.0) - 2022-04-20

### Added

- Bash/Dockerfile: Add support for named ellipses such as in
  `echo $...ARGS` (#4887)
- PHP: Constant propagation for static constants (#5022)

### Changed

- When running a baseline scan on a shallow-cloned git repository,
  Semgrep still needs enough git history available
  to reach the branch-off point between the baseline and current branch.
  Previously, Semgrep would try to gradually fetch more and more commits
  up to a thousand commits of history,
  before giving up and just fetching all commits from the remote git server.
  Now, Semgrep will keep trying smaller batches until up to a million commits.
  This change should reduce runtimes on large baseline scans on very large repositories.
- Semgrep-core now logs the rule and file affected by a memory warning.
- Improved error messages from semgrep-core (#5013)
- Small changes to text output (#5008)
- Various exit codes changed so that exit code 1 is only for blocking findings (#5039)
- Subcommand is sent as part of user agent (#5051)

### Fixed

- Lockfiles scanning now respects .semgrepignore
- Workaround for git safe.directory change in github action (#5044)
- When a baseline scan diff showed that a path changed a symlink a proper file,
  Semgrep used incorrectly skip that path. This is now fixed.
- Dockerfile support: handle image aliases correctly (#4881)
- TS: Fixed matching of parameters with type annotations. E.g., it is now possible
  to match `({ params }: Request) => { }` with `({$VAR} : $REQ) => {...}`. (#5004)

## [0.88.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.88.0) - 2022-04-13

### Added

- Scala support is now officially GA
  - Ellipsis method chaining is now supported
  - Type metavariables are now supported
- Ruby: Add basic support for lambdas in patterns. You can now write patterns
  of the form `-> (P) {Q}` where `P` and `Q` are sub-patterns. (#4950)
- Experimental `semgrep install-deep-semgrep` command for DeepSemgrep beta (#4993)

### Changed

- Moved description of parse/internal errors to the "skipped" section of output
- Since 0.77.0 semgrep-core logs a warning when a worker process is consuming above
  400 MiB of memory. Now, it will also log an extra warning every time memory usage
  doubles. Again, this is meant to help diagnosing OOM-related crashes.

### Fixed

- Dockerfile: `lang.json` file not found error while building the docker image
- Dockerfile: `EXPOSE 12345` will now parse `12345` as an int instead of a string,
  allowing `metavariable-comparison` with integers (#4875)
- Scala: unicode character literals now parse
- Scala: multiple annotated type parameters now parse (`def f[@an A, @an B](x : A, y : B) = ...`)
- Ruby: Allow 'unless' used as keyword argument or hash key (#4948)
- Ruby: Fix regexp matching in the presence of escape characters (#4999)
- `r2c-internal-project-depends-on`:
  - Generic mode rules work again
  - Semgrep will not fail on targets that contain no relevant lockfiles
  - `package-lock.json` parsing now defaults to `dependencies` instead of `packages`,
    and will not completely fail on dependencies with no version
  - `yarn.lock` parsing has been rewritten to fix a bug where sometimes
    large numbers of dependencies would be ignored
- Go: parse multiline string literals
- Handle utf-8 decoding errors without crashing (#5023)

## [0.87.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.87.0) - 2022-04-07

### Added

- New `focus-metavariable` operator that lets you focus (or "zoom in") the match
  on the code region delimited by a metavariable. This operator is useful for
  narrowing down the code matched by a rule, to focus on what really matters. (#4453)
- `semgrep ci` uses "GITHUB_SERVER_URL" to generate urls if it is available
- You can now set `NO_COLOR=1` to force-disable colored output

### Changed

- taint-mode: We no longer force the unification of metavariables between
  sources and sinks by default. It is not clear that this is the most natural
  behavior; and we realized that, in fact, it was confusing even for experienced
  Semgrep users. Instead, each set of metavariables is now considered independent.
  The metavariables available to the rule message are all metavariables bound by
  `pattern-sinks`, plus the subset of metavariables bound by `pattern-sources`
  that do not collide with the ones bound by `pattern-sinks`. We do not expect
  this change to break many taint rules because source-sink metavariable
  unification had a bug (see #4464) that prevented metavariables bound by a
  `pattern-inside` to be unified, thus limiting the usefulness of the feature.
  Nonetheless, it is still possible to force metavariable unification by setting
  `taint_unify_mvars: true` in the rule's `options`.
- `r2c-internal-project-depends-on`: this is now a rule key, and not part of the pattern language.
  The `depends-on-either` key can be used analgously to `pattern-either`
- `r2c-internal-project-depends-on`: each rule with this key will now distinguish between
  _reachable_ and _unreachable_ findings. A _reachable_ finding is one with both a dependency match
  and a pattern match: a vulnerable dependency was found and the vulnerable part of the dependency
  (according to the patterns in the rule) is used somewhere in code. An _unreachable_ finding
  is one with only a dependency match. Reachable findings are reported as coming from the
  code that was pattern matched. Unreachable findings are reported as coming from the lockfile
  that was dependency matched. Both kinds of findings specify their kind, along with all matched
  dependencies, in the `extra` field of semgrep's JSON output, using the `dependency_match_only`
  and `dependency_matches` fields, respectively.
- `r2c-internal-project-depends-on`: a finding will only be considered reachable if the file
  containing the pattern match actually depends on the dependencies in the lockfile containing the
  dependency match. A file depends on a lockfile if it is the nearest lockfile going up the
  directory tree.
- The returntocorp/semgrep Docker image no longer sets `semgrep` as the entrypoint.
  This means that `semgrep` is no longer prepended automatically to any command you run in the image.
  This makes it possible to use the image in CI executors that run provisioning commands within the image.

### Fixed

- `-` is now parsed as a valid identifier in Scala
- `new $OBJECT(...)` will now work properly as a taint sink (#4858)
- JS/TS: `...{$X}...` will no longer match `str`
- taint-mode: Metavariables bound by a `pattern-inside` are now available to the
  rule message. (#4464)
- parsing: fail fast on in semgrep-core if rules fail to validate (broken since 0.86.5)
- Setting either `SEMGREP_URL` or `SEMGREP_APP_URL`
  now updates the URL used both for Semgrep App communication,
  and for fetching Semgrep Registry rules.
- The pre-commit hook exposed from semgrep's repository no longer fails
  when trying to install with recent setuptools versions.

## [0.86.5](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.86.5) - 2022-03-28

## Changed

- Set minimum urllib3 version

## [0.86.4](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.86.4) - 2022-03-25

### Changed

- Increase rule fetch timeout from 20s to 30s

## [0.86.3](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.86.3) - 2022-03-25

### Fixed

- Network timeouts during rule download are now less likely.

## [0.86.2](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.86.2) - 2022-03-24

### Fixed

- Some finding fingerprints were not matching what semgrep-agent would return.

## [0.86.1](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.86.1) - 2022-03-24

### Fixed

- The fingerprint of findings ignored with `# nosemgrep` is supposed to be the same
  as if the ignore comment wasn't there.
  This has previously only worked for single-line findings, including in `semgrep-agent`.
  Now the fingerprint is consistent as expected for multiline findings as well.

### Changed

- `--timeout-threshold` default set to 3 instead of 0

## [0.86.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.86.0) - 2022-03-24

### Added

- Semgrep can now output findings in GitLab's SAST report and secret scanning
  report formats with `--gitlab-sast` and `--gitlab-secrets`.
- JSON output now includes a fingerprint of each finding.
  This fingerprint remains consistent when matching code is just moved around
  or reindented.
- Go: use latest tree-sitter-go with support for Go 1.18 generics (#4823)
- Terraform: basic support for constant propagation of locals (#1147)
  and variables (#4816)
- HTML: you can now use metavariable ellipsis inside <script> (#4841)
  (e.g., `<script>$...JS</script>`)
- A `semgrep ci` subcommand that auto-detects settings from your CI environment
  and can upload findings to Semgrep App when logged in.

### Changed

- SARIF output will include matching code snippet (#4812)
- semgrep-core should now be more tolerant to rules using futur extensions by
  skipping those rules instead of just crashing (#4835)
- Removed `tests` from published python wheel
- Findings are now considered identical between baseline and current scans
  based on the same logic as Semgrep CI uses, which means:
  - Two findings are now identical after whitespace changes such as re-indentation
  - Two findings are now identical after a nosemgrep comment is added
  - Findings are now different if the same code triggered them on different lines
- Docker image now runs as root to allow the docker image to be used in CI/CD pipelines
- Support XDG Base directory specification (#4818)

### Fixed

- Entropy analysis: strings made of repeated characters such as
  `'xxxxxxxxxxxxxx'` are no longer reported has having high entropy (#4833)
- Symlinks found in directories are skipped from being scanned again.
  This is a fix for a regression introduced in 0.85.0.
- HTML: multiline raw text tokens now contain the newline characters (#4855)
- Go: fix unicode parsing bugs (#4725) by switching to latest tree-sitter-go
- Constant propagation: A conditional expression where both alternatives are
  constant will also be considered constant (#4301)
- Constant propagation now recognizes operators `++` and `--` as side-effectful
  (#4667)

## [0.85.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.85.0) - 2022-03-16

### Added

- C#: use latest tree-sitter-c-sharp with support for most C# 10.0 features
- HTML: support for metavariables on tags (e.g., `<$TAG>...</$TAG>`) (#4078)
- Scala: The data-flow engine can now handle expression blocks.
  This used to cause some false negatives during taint analysis,
  which will now be reported.
- Dockerfile: allow e.g. `CMD ...` to match both `CMD ls` and `CMD ["ls"]`
  (#4770).
- When scanning multiple languages, Semgrep will now print a table of how
  many rules and files are used for each language.

### Fixed

- Fixed Deep expression matching and metavariables interaction. Semgrep will
  not stop anymore at the first match and will enumarate all possible matchings
  if a metavariable is used in a deep expression pattern
  (e.g., `<... $X ...>`). This can introduce some performance regressions.
- JSX: ellipsis in JSX body (e.g., `<div>...</div>`) now matches any
  children (#4678 and #4717)
- > ℹ️ During a `--baseline-commit` scan,
  > Semgrep temporarily deletes files that were created since the baseline commit,
  > and restores them at the end of the scan.

  Previously, when scanning a subdirectory of a git repo with `--baseline-commit`,
  Semgrep would delete all newly created files under the repo root,
  but restore only the ones in the subdirectory.
  Now, Semgrep only ever deletes files in the scanned subdirectory.

- Previous releases allowed incompatible versions (21.1.0 & 21.2.0)
  of the `attrs` dependency to be installed.
  `semgrep` now correctly requires attrs 21.3.0 at the minimum.
- `package-lock.json` parsing defaults to `packages` instead of `dependencies` as the source of dependencies
- `package-lock.json` parsing will ignore dependencies with non-standard versions, and will succesfully parse
  dependencies with no `integrity` field

### Changed

- File targeting logic has been mostly rewritten. (#4776)
  These inconsistencies were fixed in the process:

  - > ℹ️ "Explicitly targeted file" refers to a file
    > that's directly passed on the command line.

    Previously, explicitly targeted files would be unaffected by most global filtering:
    global include/exclude patterns and the file size limit.
    Now `.semgrepignore` patterns don't affect them either,
    so they are unaffected by all global filtering,

  - > ℹ️ With `--skip-unknown-extensions`,
    > Semgrep scans only the explicitly targeted files that are applicable to the language you're scanning.

    Previously, `--skip-unknown-extensions` would skip based only on file extension,
    even though extensionless shell scripts expose their language via the shebang of the first line.
    As a result, explicitly targeted shell files were always skipped when `--skip-unknown-extensions` was set.
    Now, this flag decides if a file is the correct language with the same logic as other parts of Semgrep:
    taking into account both extensions and shebangs.

- Semgrep scans with `--baseline-commit` are now much faster.
  These optimizations were added:

  - > ℹ️ When `--baseline-commit` is set,
    > Semgrep first runs the _current scan_,
    > then switches to the baseline commit,
    > and runs the _baseline scan_.

    The _current scan_ now excludes files
    that are unchanged between the baseline and the current commit
    according to `git status` output.

  - The _baseline scan_ now excludes rules and files that had no matches in the _current scan_.

  - When `git ls-files` is unavailable or `--disable-git-ignore` is set,
    Semgrep walks the file system to find all target files.
    Semgrep now walks the file system 30% faster compared to previous versions.

- The output format has been updated to visually separate lines
  with headings and indentation.

## [0.84.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.84.0) - 2022-03-09

### Added

- new --show-supported-languages CLI flag to display the list of languages
  supported by semgrep. Thanks to John Wu for his contribution! (#4754)
- `--validate` will check that metavariable-x doesn't use an invalid
  metavariable
- Add r2c-internal-project-depends on support for Java, Go, Ruby, and Rust
- PHP: .tpl files are now considered PHP files (#4763)
- Scala: Support for custom string interpolators (#4655)
- Scala: Support parsing Scala scripts that contain plain definitions outside
  an Object or Class
- JSX: JSX singleton elements (a.k.a XML elements), e.g., `<foo />` used to
  match also more complex JSX elements, e.g., `<foo >some child</foo>`.
  This can now be disabled via rule `options:`
  with `xml_singleton_loose_matching: false` (#4730)
- JSX: new matching option `xml_attrs_implicit_ellipsis` that allows
  disabling the implicit `...` that was added to JSX attributes patterns.
- new focus-metavariable: experimental operator (#4735) (the syntax may change
  in the near futur)

### Fixed

- Report parse errors even when invoked with `--strict`
- Show correct findings count when using `--config auto` (#4674)
- Kotlin: store trailing lambdas in the AST (#4741)
- Autofix: Semgrep no longer errors during `--dry-run`s where one fix changes the line numbers in a file that also has a second autofix.
- Performance regression when running with --debug (#4761)
- SARIF output formatter not handling lists of OWASP or CWE metadata (#4673)
- Allow metrics flag and metrics env var at the same time if both are set to the same value (#4703)
- Scan `yarn.lock` dependencies that do not specify a hash
- Run `project-depends-on` rules with only `pattern-inside` at their leaves
- Dockerfile patterns no longer need a trailing newline (#4773)

## [0.83.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.83.0) - 2022-02-24

### Added

- semgrep saves logs of last run to `~/.semgrep/last.log`
- A new recursive operator, `-->`, for join mode rules for recursively chaining together Semgrep rules based on metavariable contents.
- A new recursive operator, `-->`, for join mode rules for recursively
  chaining together Semgrep rules based on metavariable contents.
- Semgrep now lists the scanned paths in its JSON output under the
  `paths.scanned` key.
- When using `--verbose`, the skipped paths are also listed under the
  `paths.skipped` key.
- C#: added support for typed metavariables (#4657)
- Undocumented, experimental `metavariable-analysis` feature
  supporting two kinds of analyses: prediction of regular expression
  denial-of-service vulnerabilities (ReDoS, `redos` analyzer, #4700)
  and high-entropy string detection (`entropy` analyzer, #4672).
- A new subcommand `semgrep publish` allows users to upload private,
  unlisted, or public rules to the Semgrep Registry

### Fixed

- Configure the PCRE engine with lower match-attempts and recursion limits in order
  to prevent regex matching from potentially "hanging" Semgrep
- Terraform: Parse heredocs respecting newlines and whitespaces, so that it is
  possible to correctly match these strings with `metavariable-regex` or
  `metavariable-pattern`. Previously, Semgrep had problems analyzing e.g. embedded
  YAML content. (#4582)
- Treat Go raw string literals like ordinary string literals (#3938)
- Eliminate zombie uname processes (#4466)
- Fix for: semgrep always highlights one extra character

### Changed

- Improved constant propagation for global constants
- PHP: Constant propagation now has built-in knowledge of `escapeshellarg` and
  `htmlspecialchars_decode`, if these functions are given constant arguments,
  then Semgrep assumes that their output is also constant
- The environment variable used by Semgrep login changed from `SEMGREP_LOGIN_TOKEN` to `SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN`

## [0.82.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.82.0) - 2022-02-08

### Added

- Experimental baseline scanning. Run with `--baseline-commit GIT_COMMIT` to only
  show findings that currently exist but did not exist in GIT_COMMIT

### Changed

- Performance: send all rules directly to semgrep-core instead of invoking semgrep-core
- Scans now report a breakdown of how many target paths were skipped for what reason.
  - `--verbose` mode will list all skipped paths along with the reason they were skipped
- Performance: send all rules directly to semgrep-core instead of invoking semgrep-core
  for each rule, reducing the overhead significantly. Other changes resulting from this:
  Sarif output now includes all rules run. Error messages use full path of rules.
  Progress bar reports by file instead of by rule
- Required minimum version of python to run semgrep now 3.7 instead of EOL 3.6
- Bloom filter optimization now considers `import` module file names, thus
  speeding up matching of patterns like `import { $X } from 'foo'`
- Indentation is now removed from matches to conserve horizontal space

### Fixed

- Typescript: Patterns `E as T` will be matched correctly. E.g. previously
  a pattern like `v as $T` would match `v` but not `v as any`, now it
  correctly matches `v as any` but not `v`. (#4515)
- Solidity: ellipsis in contract body are now supported (#4587)
- Highlighting has been restored for matching code fragments within a finding

## [0.81.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.81.0) - 2022-02-02

### Added

- Dockerfile language: metavariables and ellipses are now
  supported in most places where it makes sense (#4556, #4577)

### Fixed

- Gracefully handle timeout errors with missing rule_id
- Match resources in Java try-with-resources statements (#4228)

## [0.80.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.80.0) - 2022-01-26

### Added

- Autocomplete for CLI options
- Dockerfile: add support for metavariables where argument expansion is already supported

### Changed

- Ruby: a metavariable matching an atom can also be used to match an identifier
  with the same name (#4550)

### Fixed

- Handle missing target files without raising an exception (#4462)

## [0.79.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.79.0) - 2022-01-20

### Added

- Add an experimental key for internal team use: `r2c-internal-project-depends-on` that
  allows rules to filter based on the presence of 3rd-party dependencies at specific
  version ranges.
- Experimental support for Dockerfile syntax.
- Support nosemgrep comments placed on the line before a match,
  causing such match to be ignored (#3521)
- Add experimental `semgrep login` and `semgrep logout` to store API token from semgrep.dev
- Add experimenntal config key `semgrep --config policy` that uses stored API token to
  retrieve configured rule policy on semgrep.dev

### Changed

- CLI: parse errors (reported with `--verbose`) appear once per file,
  not once per rule/file

### Fixed

- Solidity: add support for `for(...)` patterns (#4530)

## [0.78.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.78.0) - 2022-01-13

### Added

- Pre-alpha support for Dockerfile as a new target language
- Semgrep is now able to symbolically propagate simple definitions. E.g., given
  an assignment `x = foo.bar()` followed by a call `x.baz()`, Semgrep will keep
  track of `x`'s definition, and it will successfully match `x.baz()` with a
  pattern like `foo.bar().baz()`. This feature should help writing simple yet
  powerful rules, by letting the dataflow engine take care of any intermediate
  assignments. Symbolic propagation is still experimental and it is disabled by
  default, it must be enabled in a per-rule basis using `options:` and setting
  `symbolic_propagation: true`. (#2783, #2859, #3207)
- `--verbose` outputs a timing and file breakdown summary at the end
- `metavariable-comparison` now handles metavariables that bind to arbitrary
  constant expressions (instead of just code variables)
- YAML support for anchors and aliases (#3677)

### Fixed

- Rust: inner attributes are allowed again inside functions (#4444) (#4445)
- Python: return statement can contain tuple expansions (#4461)
- metavariable-comparison: do not throw a Not_found exn anymore (#4469)
- better ordering of match results with respect to captured
  metavariables (#4488)
- Go, JavaScript, Java, Python, TypeScript: correct matching of
  multibyte characters (#4490)

## [0.77.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.77.0) - 2021-12-16

### Added

- New language Solidity with experimental support.
- Scala: Patterns like List(...) now correctly match against patterns in code
- A default set of .semgrepignore patterns (in semgrep/templates/.semgrepignore) are now used if no .semgrepignore file is provided
- Java: Ellipsis metavariables can now be used for parameters (#4420)
- `semgrep login` and `semgrep logout` commands to save api token

### Fixed

- Go: fixed bug where using an ellipsis to stand for a list of key-value pairs
  would sometimes cause a parse error
- Scala: Translate definitions using patterns like
  `val List(x,y,z) = List(1,2,3)` to the generic AST
- Allow name resolution on imported packages named just vN, where N is a number
- The -json option in semgrep-core works again when used with -e/-f
- Python: get the correct range when matching comprehension (#4221)
- Python and other languages: allow matches of patterns containing
  non-ascii characters, but still with possibly many false positives (#4336)
- Java: parse correctly constructor method patterns (#4418)
- Address several autofix output issues (#4428, #3577, #3338) by adding per-
  file line/column offset tracking

### Changed

- Constant propagation is now a proper must-analysis, if a variable is undefined
  in some path then it will be considered as non-constant
- Dataflow: Only consider reachable nodes, which prevents some FPs/FNs
- Timing output handles errors and reports profiling times
- semgrep-core will log a warning when a worker process is consuming above 400 MiB
  of memory, or reached 80% of the specified memory limit, whatever happens first.
  This is meant to help diagnosing OOM-related crashes.

## [0.76.2](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.76.2) - 2021-12-08

## [0.76.2](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.76.2) - 2021-12-08

### Fixed

- Python: set the right scope for comprehension variables (#4260)
- Fixed bug where the presence of .semgrepignore would cause reported targets
  to have absolute instead of relative file paths

## [0.76.1](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.76.1) - 2021-12-07

### Fixed

- Fixed bug where the presence of .semgrepignore would cause runs to fail on
  files that were not subpaths of the directory where semgrep was being run

## [0.76.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.76.0) - 2021-12-06

### Added

- Improved filtering of rules based on file content (important speedup
  for nodejsscan rules notably)
- Semgrep CLI now respects .semgrepignore files
- Java: support ellipsis in generics, e.g., `class Foo<...>` (#4335)

### Fixed

- Java: class patterns not using generics will match classes using generics
  (#4335), e.g., `class $X { ...}` will now match `class Foo<T> { }`
- TS: parse correctly type definitions (#4330)
- taint-mode: Findings are now reported when the LHS of an access operator is
  a sink (e.g. as in `$SINK->method`), and the LHS operand is a tainted
  variable (#4320)
- metavariable-comparison: do not throw a NotHandled exn anymore (#4328)
- semgrep-core: Fix a segmentation fault on Apple M1 when using
  `-filter_irrelevant_rules` on rules with very large `pattern-either`s (#4305)
- Python: generate proper lexical exn for unbalanced braces (#4310)
- YAML: fix off-by-one in location of arrays
- Python: generate proper lexical exn for unbalanced braces (#4310)
- Matching `"$MVAR"` patterns against string literals computed by constant folding
  no longer causes a crash (#4371)

### Changed

- semgrep-core: Log messages are now tagged with the process id
- Optimization: change bloom filters to use sets, move location of filter
- Reduced the size of `--debug` dumps
- Given `--output` Semgrep will no longer print search results to _stdout_,
  but it will only save/post them to the specified file/URL

## [0.75.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.75.0) - 2021-11-23

### Fixed

- semgrep-ci relies on `--disable-nosem` still tagging findings with `is_ignored`
  correctly. Reverting optimization in 0.74.0 that left this field None when said
  flag was used

## [0.74.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.74.0) - 2021-11-19

### Added

- Support for method chaining patterns in Python, Golang, Ruby,
  and C# (#4300), so all GA languages now have method chaining
- Scala: translate infix operators to generic AST as method calls,
  so `$X.map($F)` matches `xs map f`
- PHP: support method patterns (#4262)

### Changed

- Add `profiling_times` object in `--time --json` output for more fine
  grained visibility into slow parts of semgrep
- Constant propagation: Any kind of Python string (raw, byte, or unicode) is
  now evaluated to a string literal and can be matched by `"..."` (#3881)

### Fixed

- Ruby: blocks are now represented with an extra function call in Generic so that
  both `f(...)` and `f($X)` correctly match `f(x)` in `f(x) { |n| puts n }` (#3880)
- Apply generic filters excluding large files and binary files to
  'generic' and 'regex' targets as it was already done for the other
  languages.
- Fix some Stack_overflow when using -filter_irrelevant_rules (#4305)
- Dataflow: When a `switch` had no other statement following it, and the last
  statement of the `switch`'s `default` case was a statement, such as `throw`,
  that can exit the execution of the current function, this caused `break`
  statements within the `switch` to not be resolved during the construction of
  the CFG. This could led to e.g. constant propagation incorrectly flagging
  variables as constants. (#4265)

## [0.73.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.73.0) - 2021-11-12

### Added

- experimental support for C++

### Changed

- Dataflow: Assume that any function/method call inside a `try-catch` could
  be raising an exception (#4091)
- cli: if an invalid config is passed to semgrep, it will fail immediately, even
  if valid configs are also passed

### Fixed

- Performance: Deduplicate rules by rule-id + behavior so rules are not being run
  twice
- Scala: recognize metavariables in patterns
- Scala: translate for loops to the generic ast properly
- Catch PCRE errors
- Constant propagation: Avoid "Impossible" errors due to unhandled cases

## [0.72.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.72.0) - 2021-11-10

### Added

- Java: Add partial support for `synchronized` blocks in the dataflow IL (#4150)
- Dataflow: Add partial support for `await`, `yield`, `&`, and other expressions
- Field-definition-as-assignemnt equivalence that allows matching expression
  patterns against field definitions. It is disabled by default but can be
  enabled via rule `options:` with `flddef_assign: true` (#4187)
- Arrows (a.k.a short lambdas) patterns used to match also regular function
  definitions. This can now be disabled via rule `options:` with
  `arrow_is_function: false` (#4187)
- Javascript variable patterns using the 'var' keyword used to also
  match variable declarations using 'let' or 'const'. This can now be
  disabled via rule `options:` with `let_is_var: false`

### Fixed

- Constant propagation: In a method call `x.f(y)`, if `x` is a constant then
  it will be recognized as such
- Go: match correctly braces in composite literals for autofix (#4210)
- Go: match correctly parens in cast for autofix (#3387)

- Scala: parse nullary constructors with no arguments in more positions
- Scala: parse infix type operators with tuple arguments
- Scala: parse nested comments
- Scala: parse `case class` within blocks
- `metavariable-comparison`: if a metavariable binds to a code variable that
  is known to be constant, then we use that constant value in the comparison (#3727)
- Expand `~` when resolving config paths

### Changed

- C# support is now GA
- cli: Only suggest increasing stack size when semgrep-core segfaults
- Semgrep now scans executable scripts whose shebang interpreter matches the
  rule's language

## [0.71.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.71.0) - 2021-11-01

### Added

- Metavariable equality is enforced across sources/sanitizers/sinks in
  taint mode, and these metavariables correctly appear in match messages
- Pre-alpha support for Bash as a new target language
- Pre-alpha support for C++ as a new target language
- Increase soft stack limit when running semgrep-core (#4120)
- `semgrep --validate` runs metachecks on the rule

### Fixed

- text_wrapping defaults to MAX_TEXT_WIDTH if get_terminal_size reports
  width < 1
- Metrics report the error type of semgrep core errors (Timeout,
  MaxMemory, etc.)
- Prevent bad settings files from crashing Semgrep (#4164)

  like `(=> Int) => Int`
- Bash: various fixes and improvements
- Kotlin: support ellipsis in class body and parameters (#4141)
- Go: support method interface pattern (#4172)

### Changed

- Report CI environment variable in metrics for better environment
  determination
- Bash: a simple expression pattern can now match any command argument rather
  than having to match the whole command

## [0.70.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.70.0) - 2021-10-19

### Added

- Preliminary support for bash

### Fixed

- Go: support ... in import list (#4067),
  for example `import (... "error" ...)`
- Java: ... in method chain calls can now match also 0 elements, to be
  consistent with other use of ... (#4082), so `o. ... .foo()` will now
  also match just `o.foo()`.
- Config files with only a comment give bad error message (#3773)
- Does not crash if user does not have write permissions on home directory

### Changed

- Resolution of rulesets use legacy registry instead of cdn registry
- Benchmark suite is easier to modify

## [0.69.1](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.69.1) - 2021-10-14

### Fixed

- The `--enable-metrics` flag is now always a flag, does not optionally
  take an argument

## [0.69.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.69.0) - 2021-10-13

### Added

- C: support ... in parameters and sizeof arguments (#4037)
- C: support declaration and function patterns
- Java: support @interface pattern (#4030)

### Fixed

- Reverted change to exclude minified files from the scan (see changelog for
  0.66.0)
- Java: Fixed equality of metavariables bounded to imported classes (#3748)
- Python: fix range of tuples (#3832)
- C: fix some wrong typedef inference (#4054)
- Ruby: put back equivalence on old syntax for keyword arguments (#3981)
- OCaml: add body of functor in AST (#3821)

### Changed

- taint-mode: Introduce a new kind of _not conflicting_ sanitizer that must be
  declared with `not_conflicting: true`. This affects the change made in 0.68.0
  that allowed a sanitizer like `- pattern: $F(...)` to work, but turned out to
  affect our ability to specify sanitization by side-effect. Now the default
  semantics of sanitizers is reverted back to the same as before 0.68.0, and
  `- pattern: $F(...)` is supported via the new not-conflicting sanitizers.

## [0.68.2](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.68.2) - 2021-10-07

### Fixed

- Respect --skip-unknown-extensions even for files with no extension
  (treat no extension as an unknown extension)
- taint-mode: Fixed (another) bug where a tainted sink could go unreported when
  the sink is a specific argument in a function call

## [0.68.1](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.68.1) - 2021-10-07

### Added

- Added support for `raise`/`throw` expressions in the dataflow engine and
  improved existing support for `try-catch-finally`

### Fixed

- Respect rule level path filtering

## [0.68.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.68.0) - 2021-10-06

### Added

- Added "automatic configuration" (`--config auto`), which collaborates with
  the Semgrep Registry to customize rules to a project; to support this, we
  add support for logging-in to the Registry using the project URL; in
  a future release, this will also perform project analysis to determine
  project languages and frameworks
- Input can be derived from subshells: `semgrep --config ... <(...)`
- Java: support '...' in catch (#4002)

### Changed

- taint-mode: Sanitizers that match exactly a source or a sink are filtered out,
  making it possible to use `- pattern: $F(...)` for declaring that any other
  function is a sanitizer
- taint-mode: Remove built-in source `source(...)` and built-in sanitizer
  `sanitize(...)` used for convenience during early development, this was causing
  some unexpected behavior in real code that e.g. had a function called `source`!
- When enabled, metrics now send the hashes of rules that yielded findings;
  these will be used to tailor rules on a per-project basis, and also will be
  used to improve rules over time
- Improved Kotlin parsing from 77% to 90% on our Kotlin corpus.
- Resolution of rulesets (i.e. `p/ci`) use new rule cdn and do client-side hydration
- Set pcre recursion limit so it will not vary with different installations of pcre
- Better pcre error handling in semgrep-core

### Fixed

- taint-mode: Fixed bug where a tainted sink could go unreported when the sink is
  a specific argument in a function call
- PHP: allows more keywords as valid field names (#3954)

## [0.67.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.67.0) - 2021-09-29

### Added

- Added support for break and continue in the dataflow engine
- Added support for switch statements in the dataflow engine

### Changed

- Taint no longer analyzes dead/unreachable code
- Improve error message for segmentation faults/stack overflows
- Attribute-expression equivalence that allows matching expression patterns against
  attributes, it is enabled by default but can be disabled via rule `options:` with
  `attr_expr: false` (#3489)
- Improved Kotlin parsing from 35% to 77% on our Kotlin corpus.

### Fixed

- Fix CFG dummy nodes to always connect to exit node
- Deep ellipsis `<... x ...>` now matches sub-expressions of statements
- Ruby: treat 'foo' as a function call when alone on its line (#3811)
- Fixed bug in semgrep-core's `-filter_irrelevant_rules` causing Semgrep to
  incorrectly skip a file (#3755)

## [0.66.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.66.0) - 2021-09-22

### Added

- HCL (a.k.a Terraform) experimental support

### Changed

- **METRICS COLLECTION CHANGES**: In order to target development of Semgrep features, performance improvements,
  and language support, we have changed how metrics are collected by default
  - Metrics collection is now controlled with the `--metrics` option, with possible values: `auto`, `on`, or `off`
  - `auto` will send metrics only on runs that include rules are pulled from the Semgrep Registry.
    It will not send metrics when rules are only read from local files or passed directly as
    strings
  - `auto` is now the default metrics collection state
  - `on` forces metrics collection on every run
  - `off` disables metrics collection entirely
  - Metrics collection may still alternatively be controlled with the `SEMGREP_SEND_METRICS`
    environment variable, with the same possible values as the `--metrics` option. If both
    are set, `--metrics` overrides `SEMGREP_SEND_METRICS`
  - See `PRIVACY.md` for more information
- Constant propagation now assumes that void methods may update the callee (#3316)
- Add rule message to emacs output (#3851)
- Show stack trace on fatal errors (#3876)
- Various changes to error messages (#3827)
- Minified files are now automatically excluded from the scan, which
  may result in shorter scanning times for some projects.

### Fixed

- Dataflow: Recognize "concat" method and interpret it in a language-dependent manner (#3316)
- PHP: allows certain keywords as valid field names (#3907)

## [0.65.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.65.0) - 2021-09-13

### Added

- Allow autofix using the command line rather than only with the fix: YAML key
- Vardef-assign equivalence can now be disabled via rule `options:` with `vardef_assign: false`

### Changed

## [0.64.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.64.0) - 2021-09-01

### Added

- Enable associative matching for string concatenation (#3741)

### Changed

- Add logging on failure to git ls-files (#3777)
- Ignore files whose contents look minified (#3795)
- Display semgrep-core errors in a better way (#3774)
- Calls to `semgrep --version` now check if Semgrep is up-to-date; this can
  cause a ~ 100 ms delay in run time; use --disable-version-check if you
  don't want this

### Fixed

- Java: separate import static from regular imports during matching (#3772)
- Taint mode will now benefit from semgrep-core's -filter_irrelevant_rules
- Taint mode should no longer report duplicate matches (#3742)
- Only change source directory when running in docker context (#3732)

## [0.63.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.63.0) - 2021-08-25

### Added

- C#: support ellipsis in declarations (#3720)

### Fixed

- Hack: improved support for metavariables (#3716)
- Dataflow: Disregard type arguments but not the entire instruction

### Changed

- Optimize ending `...` in `pattern-inside`s to simply match anything left

## [0.62.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.62.0) - 2021-08-17

### Added

- OCaml: support module aliasing, so looking for `List.map` will also
  find code that renamed `List` as `L` via `module L = List`.
- Add help text to sarif formatter output if defined in metadata field.
- Update shortDescription in sarif formatter output if defined in metadata field.
- Add tags as defined in metadata field in addition to the existing tags.

- Better error message when rule contains empty pattern

### Changed

- Add backtrace to fatal errors reported by semgrep-core
- Report errors during rule evaluation to the user
- When anded with other patterns, `pattern: $X` will not be evaluated on its own, but will look at the context and find `$X` within the metavariables bound, which should be significantly faster

## [0.61.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.61.0) - 2021-08-04

### Added

- Hack: preliminary support for hack-lang
  thanks to David Frankel, Nicholas Lin, and more people at Slack!
- OCaml: support for partial if, match, and try patterns
  (e.g., `if $X = $Y`)
- OCaml: you can match uppercase identifiers (constructors, module names) by
  using a metavariable with an uppercase letter followed by an underscore,
  followed by uppercase letters or digits (e.g. `$X_`, `$F_OO`).
  Instead, `$FOO` will match everything else (lowercase identifiers,
  full expressions, types, patterns, etc.).
- OCaml: match cases patterns are now matched in any order, and ellipsis are
  handled correctly
- Improved error messages sent to the playground

### Changed

- Run version check and print upgrade message after scan instead of before
- OCaml: skip ocamllex and ocamlyacc files. Process only .ml and .mli files.
- Memoize range computation for expressions and speed up taint mode
- Report semgrep-core's message upon a parse error
- Deprecated the following experimental features:
  - pattern-where-python
  - taint-mode

  calls for better range matching and autofix
- OCaml: fixed many matching bugs with ellipsis
- core: Do not crash when is not possible to compute range info
- eliminate 6x slowdown when using the '--max-memory' option

## [0.60.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.60.0) - 2021-07-27

### Added

- Detect duplicate keys in YAML dictionaries in semgrep rules when parsing a rule
  (e.g., detect multiple 'metavariable' inside one 'metavariable-regex')

### Fixed

- C/C++: Fixed stack overflows (segmentation faults) when processing very large
  files (#3538)
- JS: Fixed stack overflows (segmentation faults) when processing very large
  files (#3538)
- JS: Detect numeric object keys `1` and `0x1` as equal (#3579)
- OCaml: improved parsing stats by using tree-sitter-ocaml (from 25% to 88%)
- taint-mode: Check nested functions
- taint-mode: `foo.x` is now detected as tainted if `foo` is a source of taint
- taint-mode: Do not crash when is not possible to compute range info
- Rust: recognize ellipsis in macro calls patterns (#3600)

  duplicate patterns in a rule

## [0.59.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.59.0) - 2021-07-20

### Added

- A new experimental 'join' mode. This mode runs multiple Semgrep rules
  on a codebase and "joins" the results based on metavariable contents. This
  lets users ask questions of codebases like "do any 3rd party
  libraries use a dangerous function, and do I import that library directly?" or
  "is this variable passed to an HTML template, and is it rendered in that template?"
  with several Semgrep rules.

### Fixed

- Improve location reporting of errors
- metavariable-pattern: `pattern-not-regex` now works (#3503)
- Rust: correctly parse macros (#3513)
- Python: imports are unsugared correctly (#3940)
- Ruby: `pattern: $X` in the presence of interpolated strings now works (#3560)

## [0.58.2](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.58.2) - 2021-07-15

### Fixed

- Significant speed improvements, but the binary is now 95MB (from 47MB
  in 0.58.1, but it was 170MB in 0.58.0)

## [0.58.1](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.58.1) - 2021-07-15

### Fixed

- The --debug option now displays which files are currently processed incrementally;
  it will not wait until semgrep-core completely finishes.

### Changed

- Switch from OCaml 4.10.0 to OCaml 4.10.2 (and later to OCaml 4.12.0) resulted in
  smaller semgrep-core binaries (from 170MB to 47MB) and a smaller docker
  image (from 95MB to 40MB).

## [0.58.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.58.0) - 2021-07-14

### Added

- New iteration of taint-mode that allows to specify sources/sanitizers/sinks
  using arbitrary pattern formulas. This provides plenty of flexibility. Note
  that we breaks compatibility with the previous taint-mode format, e.g.
  `- source(...)` must now be written as `- pattern: source(...)`.
- HTML experimental support. This does not rely on the "generic" mode
  but instead really parses the HTML using tree-sitter-html. This allows
  some semantic matching (e.g., matching attributes in any order).
- Vue.js alpha support (#1751)
- New matching option `implicit_ellipsis` that allows disabling the implicit
  `...` that are added to record patterns, plus allow matching "spread fields"
  (JS `...x`) at any position (#3120)
- Support globstar (`**`) syntax in path include/exclude (#3173)

### Fixed

- Metavariable value replacement in message/autofix no longer mixes up short and long names like $X vs $X2 (#3458)
- Fixed metavariable name collision during interpolation of message / autofix (#3483)
  Thanks to Justin Timmons for the fix!
- Revert `pattern: $X` optimization (#3476)
- metavariable-pattern: Allow filtering using a single `pattern` or
  `pattern-regex`
- Dataflow: Translate call chains into IL

### Changed

### Added

- new `options:` field in a YAML rule to enable/disable certain features
  (e.g., constant propagation). See https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/blob/develop/semgrep-core/src/core/Config_semgrep.atd
  for the list of available features one can enable/disable.
- Capture groups in pattern-regex: in $1, $2, etc. (#3356)

- metavariable-pattern: Fix crash when nesting a non-generic pattern within
  a generic rule
- metavariable-pattern: Fix parse info when matching content of a metavariable
  under a different language
- generic mode on Markdown files with very long lines will now work (#2987)

### Changed

- generic mode: files that don't look like nicely-indented programs
  are no longer ignored, which may cause accidental slowdowns in setups
  where excessively large files are not excluded explicitly (#3418).
- metavariable-comparison: Fix crash when comparing integers and floats
  Thanks to Justin Timmons for the fix!
- Do not filter findings with the same range but different metavariable bindings (#3310)
- Set parsing_state.have_timeout when a timeout occurs (#3438)
- Set a timeout of 10s per file (#3434)
- Improvements to contributing documentation (#3353)
- Memoize getting ranges to speed up rules with large ranges
- When anded with other patterns, `pattern: $X` will not be evaluated on its own, but will look at the context and find `$X` within the metavariables bound, which should be significantly faster

### Added

- Keep track of and report rule parse time in addition to file parse time.
- v0 of opt-in anonymous aggregate metrics.
- Improved cheatsheet for generic mode, now recommending indented
  patterns (#2911, #3028).

- Do not assign constant values to assigned variables (#2805)
- A `--time` flag instead of `--json-time` which shows a summary of the
  timing information when invoked with normal output and adds a time field
  to the json output when `--json` is also present

### Changed

- .git/ directories are ignored when scanning
- External Python API (`semgrep_main.invoke_semgrep`) now takes an
  optional `OutputSettings` argument for controlling output

- A new `--optimizations [STR]` command-line flag to turn on/off some
  optimizations. Use 'none' to turn off everything and 'all' to turn on
  everything.
  Just using `--optimizations` is equivalent to `--optimizations all`, and
  not using `--optimizations` is equivalent to `--optimizations none`.

  and everything else is handled by its respective language extension (e.g. `.py`).
- Single array field in yaml in a pattern is parsed as a field, not a one element array

### Fixed

- SARIF output now nests invocations inside runs.
- Go backslashed carets in regexes can be parsed

### Changed

## [0.39.1](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.39.1) - 2021-01-26

No new changes in this version.
This is a re-release of 0.39.0 due to an error in the release process.

## [0.39.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.39.0) - 2021-01-26

### Added

- Typed metavariables in C.
  Patterns like `$X == $Y` can now match specific types like so: `(char *$X) == $Y`. (#2431)

#### Added in `semgrep-core` only

but have been added to the internal `semgrep-core` binary.

- `semgrep-core` supports rules in JSON and Jsonnet format. (#2428)
- `semgrep-core` supports a new nested format
  for combining patterns into a boolean query. (#2430)

### Changed

## [0.36.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.36.0) - 2021-01-05

### Added

- Typed metavariables can now match field access when we can propagate
  the type of a field
- Constant propagation for Java final fields (using this.field syntax)

### Changed

- Packaging and `setup.py` functionality (`.whl` and `pip` install unchanged):
  `SEMGREP_SKIP_BIN`, `SEMGREP_CORE_BIN`, and `SPACEGREP_BIN` now available

### Fixed

- correctly match the same metavariable for a field when used at a definition
  site and use site for Java
- add classname attribute to junit.xml report

## [0.35.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.35.0) - 2020-12-16

### Added

- Support for `...` in chains of method calls in JS, e.g. `$O.foo() ... .bar()`
- Official Ruby GA support

### Fixed

- Separate out test and pattern files with `--test` (#1796)

## [0.34.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.34.0) - 2020-12-09

### Added

- Experimental support for matching multiple arguments in JS/TS.
  This is done with a 'spread metavariable' operator,
  that looks like `$...ARGS`.
- Support for using `...` inside a Golang `switch` statement.
- Support for matching only
  the `try`, the `catch`, or the `finally` part
  of a `try { } catch (e) { } finally { }` construct in JS/TS.
- Support for matching only
  the `if ()` part of
  an `if () { }` construct in Java
- Support for metavariables inside dictionary keys in Ruby.
  This looks like `{..., $KEY: $VAL, ...}`.
- An experimental `--json-stats` flag.
  The stats output contains
  the number of files and lines of code scanned,
  broken down by language.
  It also contains profiling data broken down by rule ID.
  Please note that as this is an experimental flag,
  the output format is subject to change in later releases.
- Regex-only rules can now use `regex` as their language.
  The previously used language `none` will keep working as well.

### Changed

- Matches are now truncated to 10 lines in Semgrep's output.
  This was done to avoid filling the screen with output
  when a rule captures a whole class or function.
  If you'd like to adjust this behavior,
  you can set the new `--max-lines-per-finding` option.
- Fans of explicit & verbose code can now ignore findings
  with a `// nosemgrep` comment instead of the original `// nosem`.
  The two keywords have identical behavior.
- Generic pattern matching is now 10-20% faster
  on large codebases.

### Fixed

- Semgrep would crash when tens of thousands of matches were found
  for the same rule in one file.
  A new internally used `semgrep-core` flag named `-max_match_per_file`
  prevents these crashes by forcing a 'timeout' state
  when 10,000 matches are reached.
  Semgrep can then gracefully report
  what combination of rules and paths causes too much work.
- `semgrep --debug` works again,
  and now outputs even more debugging information from `semgrep-core`.
  The new debugging output is especially helpful to discover
  which rules have too many matches.
- A pattern that looks like `$X & $Y`
  will now correctly match bitwise AND operations in Ruby.
- Metavariables can now capture the name of a class
  and match its occurrences later in the class definition.
- Semgrep used to crash when a metavariable matched
  over text that cannot be read as UTF-8 text.
  Such matches will now try to recover what they can
  from apparent broken unicode text.

## [0.33.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.33.0) - 2020-12-01

### Added

- Allow selecting rules based on severity with the `--severity` flag. Thanks @kishorbhat!

### Changed

- In generic mode, shorter matches are now always preferred over
  longer ones. This avoids matches like `def bar def foo` when the
  pattern is `def ... foo`, instead matching just `def foo`
- In generic mode, leading dots must now match at the beginning of a
  block, allowing patterns like `... foo` to match what comes before `foo`
- Disabled link following for parity with other LINUX tools (e.g. ripgrep)
- spacegrep timeouts are now reported as timeouts instead of another error

### Fixed

- Correctly bind a metavariable in an import to the fully-qualified name. [Issue](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/1771)
- Fix invalid match locations on target files containing both CRLF line
  endings UTF-8 characters (#2111)
- Fix NoTokenLocation error when parsing Python f-strings
- [C] Support `include $X`
- [Go] Fix wrong order of imports

## [0.32.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.32.0) - 2020-11-18

### Added

- JSON output now includes an attribute of findings named `is_ignored`.
  This is `false` under regular circumstances,
  but if you run with `--disable-nosem`,
  it will return `true` for findings
  that normally would've been excluded by a `// nosem` comment.

### Changed

- `// nosemgrep` can now also be used to ignore findings,
  in addition to `// nosem`
- Added a default timeout of 30 seconds per file instead of none (#1981).

## [0.31.1](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.31.1) - 2020-11-11

### Fixed

- Regression in 0.31.0 where only a single file was being used when `--config`
  was given a directory with multiple rules (#2019).
- Cheatsheet's html functionality now has correct output.

## [0.31.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.31.0) - 2020-11-10

- Fix NO_FILE_INFO_YET error which causes the python wrapper to crash (#1925).
- Fix usage of '...' in special builtin arguments for PHP (#1963).
- Fix automatic semicolon insertion parse error in javascript (#1960).

- kotlin-tree-sitter integration into semgrep-core. Can now call
  dump-tree-sitter-cst on kotlin files.
- c++ tree-sitter integration into semgrep-core (#1952).
- More documents for language porting.
- Error handling in spacegrep to print stderr when CalledProcessError occurs.

## [0.30.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.30.0) - 2020-11-03

### Added

- Better examples for the generic mode aka spacegrep (#1951).

### Fixed

- Fix matching of trailing dots in spacegrep (#1939).
- Allow matching on one-line files with spacegrep (#1929).
- Fix incorrect number of lines matched by dots with spacegrep (#1918).
- Other subtle spacegrep matching bugs (#1913).
- Metavariable for method call should be matched against corresponding
  metavariable in method definition (#1861).
- Typescript class properties/declarations not recognized (#1846).
- Can't match inside Python try/except clause (#1902).

## [0.29.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.29.0) - 2020-10-27

### Added

- Semgrep will now partially parse files with parse errors and report findings detected before the parse errors was encountered.
- Allow user to specify registry path without having to add semgrep.dev url
  i.e.: instead of `--config https://semgrep.dev/p/r2c-ci` users can use `--config p/r2c-ci`
- Allow user to specify snippet id without having to add semgrep.dev url
  i.e.: instead of `--config https://semgrep.dev/s/username:snippetname`
  users can use `--config username:snippetname`
- `--test` will now error out if `ruleid` or `ok` is not in reported IDs
- Semgrep will run JavaScript rules on TypeScript files automatically.

### Fixed

- More off by one fixes in autofix
- Support for matching dynamic class names in Ruby
- Removed `nosem` findings from the final findings count
- Matching nested JSX elements works properly. See https://semgrep.dev/s/erlE?version=0.29.0.
- Can now match partial class definitions with annotations in Java. See https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/1877.
- Fixed errors in TypeScript "implements" keyword. See https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/1850.

## [0.28.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.28.0) - 2020-10-21

### Added

- A `metavariable-comparison` operator
  for evaluating numeric comparisons on metavariable values,
  such as `comparison: $KEY_SIZE < 2048`.
  This is a safe alternative to `pattern-where-python` snippets.
  Check the [full documentation of this feature](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/blob/12d25a5c/docs/experimental.md#metavariable-comparison)!
- Matching 1-to-N attributes with a `...` wildcard
  in JSX tags' attribute lists,
  such as `<$TAG attr="1" ... />`
- Matching only the function signature
  without the function body,
  such as `function foo(...)`.
  This is useful to have cleaner match output
  when the body content doesn't matter in a rule.
  This works on JavaScript, TypeScript, and Java code currently.
- SARIF output now includes the exact CWE and OWASP categories as tags.
  Thanks @hunt3rkillerz!
- Matching of annotation patterns for Java (like `@SomeAnnot(...)`) in any context.

### Fixed

- PHP superglobals such as `$_GET`,
  which start with a dollar sign just like Semgrep metavariables,
  are now correctly interpreted as PHP code instead of Semgrep pattern code.
- Calls to `isset(...)` in PHP look like function calls,
  but technically are not functions calls.
  Now you can match them anyway!
- It's now possible to write unit tests for OCaml rules.
- JavaScript's special identifiers,
  such as `this`, can now be captured into a metavariable.
- A Java pattern for `implements B`
  will now also match code that does `implements A, B, C`.
- Addressed off by one errors when applying autofixes
- Missing characters in metavariable interpolation in messages
- And many more minor code parser fixes!

## [0.27.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.27.0) - 2020-10-06

### Added

- Added a `--debug` flag and moved most of the output under `--verbose` to it.
- Can run multiple rule configs by repeating `--config` option
- Jenkins information added to integrations
- Added matching with partial patterns for function signatures for Go.

### Changed

- Parse and other errors are mentioned at final output, but not individually displayed unless --verbose is passed
- tree-sitter parse error exceptions converted to parsing_error, improving error location

### Fixed

- Dislayed types using the `message` key are more complete.
- Triple token repeat for EncodedString in semgrep messages fixed.
- Crashes on 3 or more layered jsonschema errors fixed.

## [0.26.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.26.0) - 2020-09-30

### Fixed

- Metavariables are able to match empty tuples
- Correctly parse optional chaining (?.) in Typescript
- Correctly parse logical assignment operators (&&=, ||=, ??=) in Typescript
- Some type constraing matching in Typescript

### Changed

- Added default timeout of 5 seconds to javascript parsing (related to ?. on large minified files stalling)

## [0.25.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.25.0) - 2020-09-23

### Added

- Added support for the JUnit XML report format (`--junit-xml`)
- C now supports the deep expression operator: `<... $X ...>`. See [this example](https://semgrep.dev/s/boKP/?version=develop).
- Added support for ellipses `...` in PHP. (https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/1715). See [this example](https://semgrep.dev/s/NxRn/?version=develop).

### Fixed

- JavaScript will parse empty yields (https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/1688).
- In JavaScript, arrow functions are now considered lambdas (https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/1691). This allows [matching](https://semgrep.dev/s/Kd1j/?version=develop) arrow functions in `var` assignments.
- `tsx` and `typescript` are now properly recognized in the `languages` key. (https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/1705)

## [0.24.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.24.0) - 2020-09-16

### Added

- The `--test` functionality now supports the `--json` flag
- Alpha support for TypeScript
- Alpha support for PHP
- PyPI artifacts are now compatible with Alpine Linux

### Fixed

- Can now parse ECMAScript object patterns with ellipses in place of fields

## [0.23.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.23.0) - 2020-09-09

### Added

- Experimental support for Typescript (with -lang ts). You can currently
  mainly use the Javascript subset of Typescript in patterns, as well
  as type annotations in variable declarations or parameters.
- Ability to read target contents from stdin by specifying "-" target.

### Changed

- You can now specify timeouts using floats instead of integers
  (e.g., semgrep -timeout 0.5 will timeout after half a second)

### Fixed

- We now respect the -timeout when analyzing languages which have
  both a Tree-sitter and pfff parser (e.g., Javascript, Go).

## [0.22.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.22.0) - 2020-09-01

### Added

- The 'languages' key now supports 'none' for running `pattern-regex` on arbitrary files. See [this file](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/blob/develop/semgrep/tests/e2e/rules/regex-any-language.yaml) for an example.
- You can now use the '...' ellipsis operator in OCaml.
- True negatives to '--test' functionality via the 'ok:<rule-id>' annotation.

### Changed

- Groups of rules are now called "Rulesets" in the Semgrep ecosystem,
  instead of their previous name, "Packs".
- We now use also the tree-sitter-javascript Javascript parser, which
  can parse quickly minified files. Thus, we also removed the 5 seconds
  parsing timeout we were using for Javascript.
- We should correctly report ranges when matching array access expressions
  (e.g., 'foo[$X]').
- Breaking: regular expressions in semgrep string patterns (e.g., `"=~/foo/"`)
  are now using the PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions) syntax instead of
  the OCaml syntax. This means you should not escape parenthesis for grouping
  or escape pipes for dijunctions (e.g., use simply `"=~/foo|bar/"` instead of
  `"=~/foo\|bar/"`). You can also use more advanced regexp features available
  in PCRE such as case-insensitive regexps with '/i' (e.g., `"=~/foo/i"`).
  The semantic of matching changes also to look for the regexp anywhere
  in the string, not just at the beginning, which means if you want to
  enforce a format for the whole string, you will now need to use the '^' anchor
  character (e.g., `"=~/^o+$/"` to check if a string contains only a sequence
  of 'o').

### Removed

- Breaking: install script installation procedure (semgrep-<version>-ubuntu-generic.sh).
  Please use 'pip install' for equivalent Linux installation.

## [0.21.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.21.0) - 2020-08-25

### Added

- Parsing JSX (JavaScript React) files is now supported as a beta feature!
  In this release, you need to target .jsx files one by one explicitly to have them be scanned.
  We're planning to scan all .jsx files in targeted directories in our next release
- We now bundle a [json-schema](https://json-schema.org/) spec for rules YAML syntax.

### Changed

- Our custom-made rules YAML validator has been replaced with a jsonschema standard one.
  This results in more reliable and comprehensive error messages
  to help you get back on track when bumping into validation issues.
- Calling `semgrep --validate` now includes more information,
  such as the number of rules validation ran on.

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where multiple assignment,
  also known as tuple unpacking assignment in Python,
  such as `a, b = foo`,
  could be misinterpreted by semgrep.
- Fixed a bug that would cause a crash when trying to get debug steps output as JSON.
- `.mly` and `.mll` files are no longer targeted implicitly by OCaml scans.
- Fixed the `--skip-unknown-extensions` flag skipping files even with recognized extensions.
- Fixed JavaScript conditionals without braces,
  such as `if (true) return;`,
  not being matched by patterns such as `if (true) { return; }`.

## [0.20.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.20.0) - 2020-08-18

### Added

- Support for JSX tag metavariables (e.g., <$TAG />) and ellipsis inside
  JSX attributes (e.g., <foo attr=... />)
- By default Semgrep treats explicitly passed files with unknown extension as possibly any language and so runs all rules on said files. Add a flag `--skip-unknown-extensions` so that Semgrep will treat these files as if they matched no language and will so run no rules on them. [Link: PR](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/pull/1507)

### Fixed

- Python patterns do not have to end with a newline anymore.
- Pattern `$X = '...';` in JavaScript matches `var $X = '...'`. Additionally, semicolon is no longer required to match. [Link: Issue](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/1497); [Link: Example](https://semgrep.dev/7g0Q?version=0.20.0)
- In JavaScript, can now match destructured object properties inside functions. [Link: Issue](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/1005); [Link: Example](https://semgrep.dev/d72E/?version=0.20.0)
- Java annotations can be matched with fully qualified names. [Link: Issue](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/1508); [Link: Example](https://semgrep.dev/vZqY/?version=0.20.0)
- Ensure `/src` exists in Dockerfile; [Link: PR](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/pull/1512)

### Added

- Match file-name imports against metavariables using `import "$X"` (most
  useful in Go)

## [0.14.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.14.0) - 2020-07-07

### Changed

- Default Docker code mount point from `/home/repo` to `/src` - this is also
  configurable via the `SEMGREP_SRC_DIRECTORY` environment variable

### Removed

- `--precommit` flag - this is no longer necessary after defaulting to
  `pre-commit`'s code mount point `/src`

### Fixed

- Parse python files with trailing whitespace
- Parse python2 tuple as parameter in function/lambda definition
- Parse python3.8 positional only parameters (PEP 570)
- Parse python2 implicit array in comprehension
- Cache timeout errors in semgrep-core so running multiple rules does not
  retry parsing

## [0.13.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.13.0) - 2020-06-30

### Added

- Const propagation now works with Java 'final' keyword and for Python globals

- Ellipsis used in the final position of a sequence of binary operations
  will match any number of additional arguments:
  ```
  $X = 1 + 2 + ...
  ```
  will match
  ```python
  foo = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4
  ```
- Per rule configuration of paths to include/exclude. See docs for more information.

### Changed

## [0.7.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.7.0) - 2020-05-12

### Added

- `--exclude`, `--include`, `--exclude-dir`, and `--include-dir` flags
  for targeting specific paths with command line options.
  The behavior of these flags mimics `grep`'s behavior.
- A `--sarif` flag to receive output formatted according to the
  [SARIF v2.1.0](https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/cs01/sarif-v2.1.0-cs01.html)
  specification for static analysis tools.
- Metavariables are now checked for equality across pattern clauses. For example, in the following pattern, `$REQ` must be the same variable name for this to match:
  ```yaml
  - patterns:
      - pattern-inside: |
          $TYPE $METHOD(..., HttpServletRequest $REQ, ...) {
            ...
          }
      - pattern: $REQ.getQueryString(...);
  ```

## [0.6.1](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.6.1) - 2020-05-06

### Fix

- Message field in output was not using proper interpolated message

## [0.6.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.6.0) - 2020-05-05

### Added

- The `-j/--jobs` flag for specifying number of subprocesses to use to run checks in parallel.
- expression statements will now match by default also return statements
  ```
  foo();
  ```
  will now match
  ```javascript
  return foo();
  ```
- You can now use regexps for field names:
  ```
  var $X = {"=~/[lL]ocation/": $Y};
  ```
  will now match
  ```javascript
  var x = { Location: 1 };
  ```
- Add severity to json output and prepend the rule line with it. Color yellow if `WARNING`, and red if `ERROR`. e.g. WARNING rule:tests.equivalence-tests
- For languages not allowing the dollar sign in identifiers (e.g., Python),
  semgrep will return an error if your pattern contains an identifier
  starting with a dollar that is actually not considered a metavariable
  (e.g., `$x`)
- Support top level `metadata` field in rule.yaml. Entire metadata object is attached to
  all things that match the rule when using json output format.

### Changed

- Config files in hidden paths can now be used by explicitly specifying
  the hidden path:
  ```
  semgrep --config some/hidden/.directory
  ```
- Metavariables can now contain digits or `_`. `$USERS_2` is now
  a valid metavariable name. A metavariable must start with a letter
  or `_` though.
- Simple calls of the `semgrep` CLI, such as `semgrep --version`, are now 60% faster.
- Display autofix suggestion in regular and json output mode.
- Update command line help texts.

### Fixed

- Correctly parse `f"{foo:,f}"` in Python
- Correctly parse Python files where the last line is a comment

## [0.5.0](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.5.0) - 2020-04-28

### Changed

- Rename executable to semgrep
- Deep expression matching in conditionals requires different syntax:
  ```
  if <... $X = True ...>:
      ...
  ```
  will now match
  ```python
  if foo == bar and baz == True:
      return 1
  ```
- Deduplicate semgrep output in cases where there are multiple ways
  a rule matches section of code
- Deep statement matchings goes into functions and classes:

  ```
  $X = ...
  ...
  bar($X)
  ```

  now matches with

  ```javascript
  QUX = "qux";

  function baz() {
    function foo() {
      bar(QUX);
    }
  }
  ```

### Added

- `python2` is a valid supported language

### Fixed

- Expression will right hand side of assignment/variable definition in javascript. See #429
  ```
  foo();
  ```
  will now match
  ```
  var x = foo();
  ```
- Regression where `"..."` was matching empty list
  ```
  foo("...")
  ```
  does _not_ match
  ```
  foo()
  ```

## [0.4.9](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v0.4.9) - 2020-04-07

### Changed

- Only print out number of configs and rules when running with verbose flag
- Match let and const to var in javascript:
  ```
  var $F = "hello"
  ```

  ```javascript
  var foo = "hello";
  let bar = "hello";
  const baz = "hello";
  ```

### Added

- Print out --dump-ast
- Print out version with `--version`
- Allow ... in arrays
  ```
  [..., 1]
  ```
  will now match
  ```
  [3, 2, 1]
  ```
- Support Metavariable match on keyword arguments in python:
  ```
  foo(..., $K=$B, ...)
  ```
  will now match
  ```
  foo(1, 2, bar=baz, 3)
  ```
- Support constant propogation in f-strings in python:
  ```
  $M = "..."
  ...
  $Q = f"...{$M}..."
  ```
  will now match
  ```python
  foo = "bar"
  baz = f"qux {foo}"
  ```
- Constant propogation in javascript:

  ```
  api("literal");
  ```

  will now match with any of the following:

  ```javascript
  api("literal");

  const LITERAL = "literal";
  api(LITERAL);

  const LIT = "lit";
  api(LIT + "eral");

  const LIT = "lit";
  api(`${LIT}eral`);
  ```

- Deep statement matching:
  Elipsis operator (`...`) will also include going deeper in scope (i.e. if-else, try-catch, loop, etc.)
  ```
  foo()
  ...
  bar()
  ```
  will now match
  ```python
  foo()
  if baz():
      try:
          bar()
      except Exception:
          pass
  ```
- Unified import resolution in python:

  ```
  import foo.bar.baz
  ```

  will now match any of the following statements:

  ```python
  import foo.bar.baz
  import foo.bar.baz.qux
  import foo.bar.baz as flob
  import foo.bar.baz.qux as flob
  from foo.bar import baz
  from foo.bar.baz import qux
  from foo.bar import baz as flob
  from foo.bar.bax import qux as flob
  ```

- Support for anonymous functions in javascript:
  ```
  function() {
      ...
  }
  ```
  will now match
  ```javascript
  var bar = foo(
    //matches the following line
    function () {
      console.log("baz");
    }
  );
  ```
- Support arrow function in javascript

  ```
  (a) => { ... }
  ```

  will now match:

  ```javascript
  foo((a) => {
    console.log("foo");
  });
  foo((a) => console.log("foo"));

  // arrows are normalized in regular Lambda, so an arrow pattern
  // will match also old-style anynonous function.
  foo(function (a) {
    console.log("foo");
  });
  ```

- Python implicit string concatenation
  ```
  $X = "..."
  ```
  will now match
  ```python
  # python implicitly concatenates strings

  ```
  var {foo, bar} = qux;
  ```
  will now match
  ```
  var {bar, baz, foo} = qux;
  ```
- Defining properties/functions in different order:

  ```
  var $F = {
      two: 2,
      one: 1
  };
  ```

  will now match both

  ```javascript
  var foo = {
    two: 2,
    one: 1,
  };

  var bar = {
    one: 1,
    two: 2,
  };
  ```

- Metavariables were not matching due to go parser adding empty statements in golang

## [0.4.8](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/0.4.8) - 2020-03-09

### Added

- Constant propagation for some languages. Golang example:

```
pattern: dangerous1("...")
will match:

const Bar = "password"
func foo() {
     dangerous1(Bar);
}
```

- Import matching equivalences

```
pattern: import foo.bar.a2
matches code: from foo.bar import a1, a2
