  # For the benchmarks below, we had two alternatives:
  # A. run semgrep container from existing container: requires mounting
  #    a volume, which is disabled by CircleCI (results in empty folder
  #    once mounted).
  # B. run everything inside the semgrep-dev container, which comes with
  #    semgrep and whatever utilities we added.
  #
  # We use B out of necessity.
